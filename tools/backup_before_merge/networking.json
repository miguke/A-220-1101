    "explanation": "It is common for companies to place a data cap on the devices they provide to their employees, to control costs. If a user has exceeded the data cap, the phone\nmay no longer allow internet browsing over a cellular connection. This is usually because the cellular data usage has exceeded the allotted amount for the\nparticular plan the device is on, and the service provider has temporarily suspended the data connection.\nIt is unlikely that the child accidentally connected to a neighbor's WLAN because this would not affect the cellular data connection. Similarly, it is unlikely that the\ncompany's group policy has disabled the device, as this would likely affect all devices under the same policy. If the device's plan has been unpaid, the service\nprovider would likely temporarily suspend all services, not just the cellular data connection.\nReference: CompTIA A+ Core 1 Exam Guide, page 329.",

    "explanation": "Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the most appropriate protocol to use for inventory tracking in a small warehouse. RFID is a technology that uses radio\nwaves to identify and track objects that have RFID tags attached to them. RFID tags are small devices that store information about the object, such as its name,\nserial number, location, or status. RFID tags can be passive, which means they do not have a battery and rely on the radio signal from the reader to power them,\nor active, which means they have a battery and can transmit their own signal. RFID readers are devices that can scan the RFID tags and read the information\nstored on them.\nRFID is suitable for inventory tracking in a small warehouse because it can provide several benefits, such as:\n? Faster and more accurate scanning: RFID tags can be scanned without direct line\nof sight, unlike barcodes, and can be scanned in bulk, unlike QR codes. This means that RFID readers can scan multiple items at once, even if they are inside\nboxes or containers, and reduce the time and errors involved in manual scanning.\n? Real-time visibility and control: RFID tags can be updated with the latest\ninformation about the inventory, such as its location, quantity, or condition. This means that RFID readers can provide real-time data and feedback on the inventory\nstatus, such as its availability, movement, or expiration. This can help improve inventory management, optimize warehouse space, and prevent stockouts or\noverstocking.\n? Enhanced security and quality: RFID tags can be encrypted and authenticated,\nunlike barcodes or QR codes, which can be easily copied or tampered with. This means that RFID tags can prevent unauthorized access or theft of the inventory,\nand ensure its authenticity and quality. This can help protect the inventory from damage, loss, or fraud, and increase customer satisfaction and trust.\nReferences:\n?

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Cat 6.\nAn RJ45 connector is a standard type of physical connector for network cables. RJ45 connectors are used almost exclusively with Ethernet cables and\nnetworking1. Ethernet cables are twisted pair cables that carry data signals between devices on a network, such as computers, routers, switches, and servers2.\nThere are different categories of Ethernet cables, such as Cat 5, Cat 5e, Cat 6, and Cat 7, that have different specifications and performance levels. Cat 6 is one of\nthe most common types of Ethernet cables, which supports data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps and bandwidth up to 250 MHz3. Cat 6 cables have four pairs of\ncopper wires, each with a plastic insulation and a foil or braided shield. The wires are twisted together to reduce crosstalk and interference4.\nTo terminate a Cat 6 cable, an administrator needs to use an RJ45 connector that matches the wiring scheme of the cable. There are two common wiring schemes\nfor Ethernet cables: T568A and T568B. The administrator needs to strip the cable jacket, untwist the wires, arrange them in the correct order according to the\nchosen scheme, trim the excess wire, and insert them into the RJ45 connector.

    "question": "A network technician needs to provide better wireless connectivity throughout a SOHO location. Which of the following should the technician deploy to best\nimprove connectivity?",
    "options": [

      "POE hub",
      "Wi-Fi router"
    ],
    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Access point.\nAn access point is a device that extends the wireless coverage of a network by creating a hotspot that allows wireless devices to connect to the network1. An\naccess point can be connected to a router or a switch via an Ethernet cable or a wireless bridge1. By deploying one or more access points throughout a SOHO\nlocation, the technician can provide better wireless connectivity and eliminate dead zones or weak signals2.\nA managed switch is a device that allows multiple devices to communicate on a network by forwarding data packets based on their destination addresses3. A\nmanaged switch can also provide advanced features such as VLANs, QoS, security, and remote management3. However, a managed switch does not improve\nwireless connectivity, as it only works with wired devices.\nA POE hub is a device that provides power and data over a single Ethernet cable to devices that support Power over Ethernet (PoE) technology, such as IP\ncameras, VoIP phones, and wireless access points4. A POE hub can simplify the installation and placement of these devices by eliminating the need for separate\npower adapters or outlets4. However, a POE hub does not improve wireless connectivity by itself, as it still requires an access point or a router to create a wireless\nnetwork.\nA Wi-Fi router is a device that combines the functions of a router and an access point, providing both wired and wireless connectivity to a network and the internet.\nA Wi-Fi router can be used to create a SOHO network, but it may not be sufficient to cover the entire location with a strong and reliable wireless signal. To improve\nwireless connectivity, the technician may need to add additional access points or use a mesh Wi-Fi system that consists of multiple routers that work together to\ncreate a seamless wireless network. Therefore, an access point is the best option among the choices to improve wireless connectivity throughout a SOHO\nlocation.",

OLED.\nOLED stands for Organic Light-emitting Diode, and it is one of the three display types available for laptops, along with TN (Twisted Nematic) and IPS (In-Plane\nSwitching) panels1. OLED displays use organic compounds that emit light when an electric current is applied, unlike LCD displays that use a backlight to illuminate\nthe pixels. OLED displays\nhave several advantages over LCD displays, such as higher contrast, wider viewing angles, faster response times, and lower power consumption2. However,\nOLED displays are also more expensive, less common, and more prone to burn-in than LCD displays2. CRT (Cathode Ray Tube), DLP (Digital Light Processing),\nand Plasma are not display types for laptops. CRT is an old technology that uses a vacuum tube to project an image on a phosphor screen. CRT monitors are\nbulky, heavy, and consume a lot of power3. DLP is a technology that uses a digital micromirror device and a light source to project an image on a screen or a wall.\nDLP is mainly used for projectors, not laptops4.
