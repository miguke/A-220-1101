        12: "Installing Linux as a virtual machine is the most efficient solution for parallel execution. VMs allow running both Windows and Linux simultaneously without rebooting, use minimal bandwidth (only for VM setup), and provide isolation between systems. PaaS cloud requires constant internet connectivity, swappable drives require physical hardware changes and rebooting, and dual boot prevents parallel execution as only one OS can run at a time.",
        
        13: "The correct setting is 'Choose What Closing the Lid Does' → 'When I Close the Lid' → 'Do Nothing' for plugged-in mode. This specifically controls laptop lid behavior when connected to external power (docking station). The other options control sleep timing but don't address the lid-closing trigger, and display settings don't prevent the system from sleeping when the lid closes.",
        
        14: "Speech recognition is found in 'Ease of Access' settings in Windows 10. This section contains accessibility features including speech recognition, narrator, magnifier, and other assistive technologies. Language settings control regional formats, System shows hardware info, and Personalization handles themes and appearance - none of these contain speech recognition configuration.",
        
        15: "WPA3 is the most secure Wi-Fi protocol available. It provides the strongest encryption (AES-256), improved protection against brute-force attacks, and enhanced security for open networks. WPA-AES and WPA-TKIP are older WPA2 variants with weaker security, and WEP is extremely vulnerable and should never be used in modern networks.",
        
        16: "Configuring the network as 'Private' enables network discovery and file sharing features in Windows, allowing access to shared drives on other computers. Private network profile enables SMB/CIFS protocols needed for file sharing. Proxy servers are for internet access control, administrator roles are unnecessary for basic file sharing, and public documents shortcuts don't provide access to other computers' shared drives.",
        
        17: "Disk Utility is the correct macOS tool for partition management. It handles disk formatting, partitioning, resizing, and repair functions. Console shows system logs, Time Machine is for backups, and FileVault provides disk encryption - none of these can resize partitions.",
        
        18: "Clean install is the best method for preparing a laptop for a new employee. It completely removes all previous user data, applications, and configurations, providing a fresh, secure starting point. Internet-based and in-place upgrades preserve existing data, repair installation fixes problems but doesn't remove user data, and USB repair is for troubleshooting, not preparation.",
        
        19: "Clearing the application cache should be attempted first as it's the least disruptive solution. App crashes often result from corrupted cache files, and clearing cache preserves user data and settings. Uninstalling removes all data, factory reset affects the entire device, and alternative applications don't solve the original app's problem.",
        
        20: "Recalibrating the accelerometer will most likely resolve autorotate issues. The accelerometer detects device orientation changes and triggers screen rotation. Magnetometer detects magnetic fields, compass shows direction, and digitizer handles touch input - none of these control screen rotation functionality.",
        
        21: "Windows Professional Edition is most appropriate for corporate domain environments. It includes domain join capabilities, Group Policy support, and enterprise security features needed for corporate networks. Enterprise edition is more expensive and typically for large organizations, Server editions are for servers not client computers, and Home edition lacks domain join functionality."
