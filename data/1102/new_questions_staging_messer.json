The incorrect answers: B. Download the shared folder through a proxy There's no mention of a proxy in the question, and adding a proxy to this process would not provide any additional features or benefits. C. Link the images to a cloud storage service Operating system images are relatively large, and transferring them to an external cloud-based service would add additional time and bandwidth to resources that are already located on a local file server.

MBR The MBR (Master Boot Record) partition style provides a maximum of four bootable primary partitions per drive. B. NTFS NTFS (NT File System) is a file system designed for Windows computers. Although a system may store files using NTFS, the partition style containing the NTFS file system would determine the maximum number of supported partitions. C. diskpart The diskpart utility is a command line option for managing partition styles and bootable configurations.

To remove the malware, it's important the technician is using the latest set of signatures. The incorrect answers: B. Educate the end-user This is one of the most important tasks for malware removal, but it's usually reserved for the final step when there's no longer any urgency to remove the malware. C. Schedule anti-virus scans for midnight each day Once the virus is removed, the system should be configured for on-demand scanning and additional scans each day. However, this would not immediately follow the disabling of System Restore. D. Boot the system with the original installation media Booting into a command line from the original Windows installation media may be required for more difficult virus removal tasks, but this would only occur after the latest anti-virus signatures were downloaded and installed.

    "explanation": "Disable System Restore before removal Malware does not like to be removed from a system, so it does everything it can to remain in the operating system. When the malware infects the running operating system, it also infects all of the previous restore points as well. If the restore points aren't removed with the malware, then going back in time to a previous restore point will reinfect the system. The incorrect answers: A. Boot to a pre-installation environment A pre-installation environment is often required during the remediation phase to assist with the malware removal. The use of a pre-installation environment does not commonly have any effect on future reinfections. B. Identify malware symptoms Since malware was previously removed from this system, we can assume that the malware was originally identified. D. Update to the latest BIOS version Updating the BIOS isn't commonly considered part of the malware removal process, and using an older BIOS version doesn't generally cause a device to be more susceptible to malware infections.

Remove the server from the Active Directory domain An Active Directory domain allows a domain administrator to centrally manage security policies and to provide ongoing monitoring of a device. The server would be less secure if it were removed from the AD domain. C.

Given the available options, MAC filtering would be the only way to provide this type of device exclusion. The incorrect answers: A. SSID suppression The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of the wireless network, and most access points allow the administrator to control the broadcasting of the network name. This option would prevent the display of the name on a list of available wireless networks, but a device could connect to the network if the name was already known. B. Content filtering Content filtering refers to the control of information inside of an existing data flow. This commonly controls based on the URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) associated with websites, allowing the administrator to allow or deny access to certain categories of online content. This functionality would not be used to limit wireless network access for a single device. 124 Practice Exam A - Answers C. Static IP addressing Static IP addressing would require the administrator to manually assign IP addresses to all of the devices on the network.

It's up to the technician to manage this open line of communication. The incorrect answers: A. Move the installation to the next business day Moving the scheduled installation to the next business day without any other input would not be the best way to manage this repair. If the repair was time-sensitive, moving the installation may be the worst way to proceed. B. Schedule another repair into today's newly opened time slot Before prioritizing another repair into the existing time, it would be useful to know if there might be another option for the customer rather than to wait a day for the delivery to arrive.

    "explanation": "Use a cloud backup service Using a cloud backup service such as Apple iCloud or Google Drive provides an automated method to constantly backup all user data on the smartphone. If the phone is lost or stolen, the user can purchase a new smartphone and restore all of the data from the cloud. The incorrect answers: A. Connect an external USB drive Most smartphones do not support a backup to USB. This option would also require the user to connect the USB drive multiple times and day and to maintain access to the USB flash drive. B. Use incremental backups each night Running nightly backups would not provide ongoing backups throughout the business day. C. Connect the smartphone to a laptop Most smartphone operating systems support the creation of a local backup to a connected computer, but this would not provide backups automatically throughout the day and would require manual intervention by the user.

The incorrect answers: A. Padded envelope A padded envelope would protect against physical damage, but it wouldn't provide any protection for inadvertent static discharge. Since the SSD doesn't include any moving parts, the padded envelope would provide limited protection. C. Box with foam filler The SSD does not have any moving parts, so extensive protection against bumps and movement isn't necessary. It would be more important to protect the delicate electronics on the drive, and the foam filler does not generally provide any anti-static protection. D.

    "explanation": "Modify the default permissions Many system administrators configure their accounts to have full access to the network as their default setting. This means that malicious software would also have full access if the administrator's desktop was exploited. Changing the default permissions to have limited access would also limit the scope of a Trojan horse exploit. The incorrect answers: A. Require multi-factor authentication A Trojan horse exploit uses the permissions associated with the logged-in user. Requiring additional authentication factors will not have any effect on the scope of the malware infection. B. Disable all guest accounts Although disabling guest accounts is always a good best practice, the Trojan horse uses the current user permissions and does not require a guest account to function. D. Configure full disk encryption Full disk encryption protects the data on a storage drive if a device is lost or stolen. Once a user is logged in, the data can be accessed normally and the encryption is no longer a limitation to any user processes (such as a Trojan horse). 200 Practice Exam B - Answers E. Require complex passwords A complex password would protect against unauthorized user access, but it won't stop a Trojan horse from exploiting a system using the current user's account permissions. F. Require a screensaver lock A screensaver password protects a system when the user is away from their desktop. A Trojan horse is executed by the user at an active workstation, so configuring a screensaver password would not protect against this infection.

If the default password is configured on a router, then anyone would be able to make changes on the device. The incorrect answers: A. Configure MAC address filtering MAC (Media Access Control) address filtering is an administrative tool to allow or deny access to the network. MAC filtering is not a security feature. B. Enable WPS connectivity WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) is a configuration method for securely connecting devices to a wireless network. WPS is not used to protect the configuration settings of a router. D. Disable unneeded interfaces Limiting access to interfaces is a good best practice, but it doesn't prevent an attacker from changing the configurations in the router.

To work around this issue, a technician may often need to restart in Safe Mode and copy utilities and recovery files from a different computer. The incorrect answers: B. Roll back to a previous configuration Viruses often infect both the current configuration and those contained in restore points. In this case, the System Restore feature has already been disabled, so no restore points would be available on this system. C. Schedule periodic updates and reconnect to the network Since the manual update process is failing, it's most likely an automated update would also fail. D.

If the default gateway isn't working, users will not be able to access services that are outside of the local subnet. The incorrect answers: B. DNS server The DNS server converts between a fully qualified domain name and an IP address. In this example, the technician was attempting to ping external devices by IP address, so the DNS server would not be part of this issue. C. Proxy server A proxy server is commonly used to provide security for incoming or outgoing web services. A technician pinging an external IP address would not commonly be communicating through a proxy server. D. Metered connection A metered connection will limit the type and amount of traffic sent over a network connection.

To avoid any issues, it would be best to have a trusted third-party remove the sensitive information from the area. C. Move the papers somewhere out of sight Moving any papers, especially papers containing sensitive information, would not be a good idea.

One significant advantage of any off-site backup or storage is to have access to the data if the primary site was to have any type of disaster. The incorrect answers: A. Battery backup Battery backup such as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) would provide a backup power source if the primary power was to become unavailable. A UPS would not provide any method of data backup or data recovery. C. RADIUS administration servers RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) servers authenticate login processes to a centralized user database. In the case of a disaster, users would still be able to login to their important services using these authentication technologies.

    "explanation": "User’s permissions have been modified The login process and Windows desktop are working normally without any identified errors, so the operating system is most likely working normally. Since the normal list of shares has changed, then it's most likely that something has been modified with the share permissions. The incorrect answers: B. User is running untrusted software Untrusted software can be managed in many different ways, but a share not appearing is not commonly associated with untrusted software. The display of the share is managed by the operating system, so this issue would most likely be associated with a permission change or problem. C. Network is using MAC filtering MAC (Media Access Control) filtering allows or prevents a device from communicating on a network. MAC filtering is not used to limit or restrict access to a particular Windows share. D. Port security is enabled Port security allows the network administrator to provide access to the network based on a user's login credentials. Port security is not used to limit access to a Windows share.

Individual personal licenses might be appropriate for smaller groups of users, but larger licensing agreements are required when purchasing for an entire organization. C. Open-source license An open-source license does not commonly require any payment, so there isn't usually a commercial component or financial arrangement associated with the use of open-source licensing.

    "explanation": "Perform a hardware diagnostic, and F. Scan for viruses and malware Without knowing the root cause of the issue, it will be important to gather as much information about the issue without making any changes to the operating system or applications. A diagnostic would provide information about the health of the hardware, and scanning for viruses would check for any malicious software. Neither of those options would make any changes to the configuration of the system. The incorrect answers: A. Start the computer in Safe Mode Since this issue occurs over time, simply staring the computer in Safe Mode would not provide much information about the issue. C. Connect the computer to a different VLAN The issue does not appear to be related to network connectivity, so choosing a different VLAN for this computer would most likely not result in any change. VLAN assignments don't tend to slow computers down over time, so this would also not be a common solution to the issue. 354 Practice Exam C - Answers D. Update the OS to the latest patches Before making any changes to the operating system, it would be more important to gather information and test components without changing application or operating system files. E. Roll back to a previous configuration There's no evidence that the current issue is related to a specific changes, so rolling back to a previous configuration would not be the best of the available options. This option would also make changes to the existing configuration before understanding what the root cause might be.

The server's certificate has a specific issuing and expiration date and time, so time drift on the workstation could cause the validation to fail on the workstation. The incorrect answers: A. Disable Windows Firewall for all HTTPS traffic HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a secure protocol used for encrypted communication to a website. Disabling the firewall for HTTPS traffic will not change the validation process of a web site certificate. B. Create a new certificate for the user's computer The certificate failing the validation is located on the web server.

    "question": "A company has created an internal process to ensure that all PII is encrypted. Which of the following would be the MOST likely reason for adding this additional security?",
    "options": [
      "Helps prevent identity theft",
      "Improves application performance",
      "Allows customer data to be easily deleted",

    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "Helps prevent identity theft PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is any information that can identify an individual. This information can be an address, phone number, or date of birth. Encrypting PII will help prevent the unintended release of personal data and would assist with preventing identity theft. The incorrect answers: B. Improves application performance The process of encrypting and decrypting data adds more overhead to the data storage process. Although application performance may not become any worse, the encryption process would not commonly improve performance. C. Allows customer data to be easily deleted The removal of customer data is not made easier through the use of encryption. Although it's useful to have processes to remove user information, that process is managed in conjunction with the encryption and decryption process. D. Uses less storage space The encryption process would not commonly be used as a way to decrease the use of storage space. If encryption and decryption is being used, there is most likely a security focus for implementing such a process.
