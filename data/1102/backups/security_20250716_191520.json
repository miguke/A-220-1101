    "explanation": "The technician should adjust the firewall settings to resolve the issue of not being able to access an internal site at https://companyintranet.com:8888. The firewall\nsettings control how the firewall filters and allows network traffic based on rules and policies. The firewall settings may be blocking or preventing the access to the\ninternal site by mistake or by default, especially if the site uses a non-standard port number such as 8888. The technician should check and modify the firewall\nsettings to allow the access to the internal site or its port number. Default gateway settings determine how a computer connects to other networks or the internet.\nDefault gateway settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access the public internet. DHCP settings\ndetermine how a computer obtains its IP address and other network configuration parameters automatically from a DHCP server. DHCP settings are not likely to\ncause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. IP address settings determine how a computer\nidentifies itself and communicates with other devices on a network. IP address settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site\nif the user can access other network resources. Antivirus settings control how the antivirus software scans and protects the computer from malware and threats.\nAntivirus settings are less likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site than firewall settings, unless the antivirus software has its own\nfirewall feature that may interfere with the network traffic.

    "explanation": "The best explanation for why the system still has malware after performing a System Restore is that the malware was installed before the system restore point was\ncreated. A system restore point is a snapshot of the system settings and configuration at a certain point in time. A System Restore is a feature that allows users to\nrestore their system to a previous state in case of problems or errors. However, a System Restore does not affect personal files or folders, and it may not remove\nmalware that was already present on the system before the restore point was created.

      2
    ],
    "explanation": "Low-level wiping is the best data destruction method for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Low-level wiping is a process that overwrites every bit of data on a\ndrive with zeros or random patterns, making it impossible to recover any data from the drive. Low-level wiping also restores the\nhard\ndrive to its factory state, removing any bad sectors or errors that may have accumulated over time. Low-level wiping can be done using specialized software tools\nor hardware devices that connect to the drive. Degaussing, standard formatting, and deleting are not suitable data destruction methods for recycling old hard\ndrives for reuse. Degaussing is a process that exposes a hard drive to a strong magnetic field, destroying both the data and the drive itself. Degaussing renders\nthe drive unusable for reuse. Standard formatting is a process that erases the data on a hard drive by removing the file system structure, but it does not overwrite\nthe data itself. Standard formatting leaves some data recoverable using forensic tools or software utilities. Deleting is a process that removes the data from a hard\ndrive by marking it as free space, but it does not erase or overwrite the data itself. Deleting leaves most data recoverable using undelete tools or software utilities.\nReferences:\n? Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 15\n?

    "explanation": "Quarantining the infected system is the most appropriate way to remediate the issue of an infection that the antivirus software cannot remove. Quarantining means\nisolating the system from the network and other devices to prevent the infection from spreading or causing further damage. Quarantining also allows the technician\nto perform further analysis and removal of the infection without risking the security of other systems or data.\nSome of the steps involved in quarantining an infected system are:\n? Disconnect the system from the internet and any local network connections, such as Wi-Fi, Ethernet, Bluetooth, or USB.\n? Disable any file-sharing or remote access services on the system, such as Windows File Sharing, Remote Desktop, or TeamViewer.\n? Use a separate device to download and update the antivirus software and any other tools that may be needed to remove the infection, such as malware\nscanners, rootkit removers, or bootable rescue disks.\n? Transfer the updated antivirus software and tools to the infected system using a removable media, such as a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive. Scan the removable\nmedia for any infections before and after using it on the infected system.\n? Run the antivirus software and tools on the infected system and follow the instructions to delete or quarantine the infection. If the infection is persistent or\ncomplex, it may require booting the system from a rescue disk or using a Linux live disc to access and clean the system files.\n? After the infection is removed, restore the system to a previous clean state using\nSystem Restore, backup, or recovery partition. Scan the system again to ensure that it is clean and secure.

    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "Share permissions restrict access from remote devices NTFS (NT File System) permissions are used to control access from both local users and users over the network. For users connected over the network, the Windows share permissions are also used to determine access. If access is available locally but not across the network, then it's likely that the share permissions include additional access restrictions. The incorrect answers: A. The NTFS permissions were not synchronized NTFS does not require any permissions to be synchronized or copied between systems. C. The user is an Administrator A Windows Administrator would not commonly be restricted from accessing local files, but this issue is not related to the local NTFS permissions. Since the access problems are for users across the network, the share permissions would most likely be the issue. D. Remote users are connecting with Guest accounts All remote access is managed through Windows share permissions. These share permissions, combined with the NTFS permissions, determine the rights that remote users will have to the resources.

The password complexity policy would need to be active prior to the authentication process. B. Folder redirection Folder redirection allows a Windows administrator to redirect user storage from a local folder to a server share. This allows for the centralized storage of files and the ability to access the files from anywhere on the network. The folder redirection would not change password complexity policies. C. Port security Port security is used in the Windows Firewall to allow or prevent access to a specific TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol) port.

      0
    ],
    "explanation": "Install the latest OS patches This system will be used during non-working hours from a location that is not part of your organization, so keeping the operating system secure will be important. Maintaining an aggressive patching schedule will ensure that any known vulnerabilities are always removed before they could possibly be exploited. The incorrect answers: B. Remove the server from the Active Directory domain An Active Directory domain allows a domain administrator to centrally manage security policies and to provide ongoing monitoring of a device. The server would be less secure if it were removed from the AD domain. C. Use only 64-bit applications There's no enhanced security with 64-bit applications, so ensuring the use of those applications wouldn't provide any significant security advantages. D. Run a weekly anti-virus scan The concern with this server is that it will be accessed by unknown third- parties from the partner's network. Running an anti-virus scan every week would not provide any significant security benefit, and would probably be delivered too late to be of use.

      4
    ],
    "explanation": "MAC filtering MAC (Media Access Control) address filtering can be configured to allow or deny access to the network based on the hardware address of the wireless network adapter. Given the available options, MAC filtering would be the only way to provide this type of device exclusion. The incorrect answers: A. SSID suppression The SSID (Service Set Identifier) is the name of the wireless network, and most access points allow the administrator to control the broadcasting of the network name. This option would prevent the display of the name on a list of available wireless networks, but a device could connect to the network if the name was already known. B. Content filtering Content filtering refers to the control of information inside of an existing data flow. This commonly controls based on the URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) associated with websites, allowing the administrator to allow or deny access to certain categories of online content. This functionality would not be used to limit wireless network access for a single device. 124 Practice Exam A - Answers C. Static IP addressing Static IP addressing would require the administrator to manually assign IP addresses to all of the devices on the network. However, this manual assignment is not a security feature and would not necessarily restrict access to the network from any device. D. DHCP reservation A DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) reservation is used to associate the MAC (Media Access Control) address of a device to a specific IP address.

The best way to prevent this access is to completely disable the accounts while they are not in use. The incorrect answers: A. Uninstall the audit software Uninstalling the audit software doesn't prevent the auditor accounts from logging into the network or accessing other resources. C. Remove the auditor accounts from all Windows groups Removing the auditor accounts from the Windows groups does not prevent them from logging into the network, and it doesn't prevent those accounts from being added to other groups in the future. D. Require two-factor authentication for the auditor accounts Making the login process more difficult doesn't make it impossible. Disabling the accounts would be the most secure, regardless of the number of authentication factors in use.

    "question": "A system administrator has inadvertently installed a Trojan horse that has deleted a number of files across many Windows file shares. The Trojan also had access to user documents and login credentials and transmitted numerous documents to an off-site file storage system. Which of the following would limit the scope of future exploits?",
    "options": [
      "Require multi-factor authentication",
      "Disable all guest accounts",

      "Require a screensaver lock"
    ],
    "correct": [
      2
    ],
    "explanation": "Modify the default permissions Many system administrators configure their accounts to have full access to the network as their default setting. This means that malicious software would also have full access if the administrator's desktop was exploited. Changing the default permissions to have limited access would also limit the scope of a Trojan horse exploit. The incorrect answers: A. Require multi-factor authentication A Trojan horse exploit uses the permissions associated with the logged-in user. Requiring additional authentication factors will not have any effect on the scope of the malware infection. B. Disable all guest accounts Although disabling guest accounts is always a good best practice, the Trojan horse uses the current user permissions and does not require a guest account to function. D. Configure full disk encryption Full disk encryption protects the data on a storage drive if a device is lost or stolen. Once a user is logged in, the data can be accessed normally and the encryption is no longer a limitation to any user processes (such as a Trojan horse). 200 Practice Exam B - Answers E. Require complex passwords A complex password would protect against unauthorized user access, but it won't stop a Trojan horse from exploiting a system using the current user's account permissions. F. Require a screensaver lock A screensaver password protects a system when the user is away from their desktop. A Trojan horse is executed by the user at an active workstation, so configuring a screensaver password would not protect against this infection.

    "question": "A medical center's hospital staff uses shared computer systems installed in hallways and patient rooms. However, hospital administrators are concerned that patient information might be visible if someone leaves the computer without logging out. Which of the following would help prevent this type of issue?",
    "options": [
      "Multi-factor authentication",
      "Password expiration policy",
      "Login time restrictions",
      "Screensaver passwords"

    "explanation": "Screensaver passwords Screensaver passwords would ensure the information on the computer would be protected if someone walks away and leaves the system unattended. Other security enhancements might include a proximity monitor to automatically lock the system when someone walks away, making the screensaver password a good secondary security option. The incorrect answers: A. Multi-factor authentication Additional authentication factors would only provide security during the login process. B. Password expiration policy It's a good best practice to periodically require updated passwords, but those policies are not designed to protect a system that has been unlocked. C. Login time restrictions A login time restriction would prevent someone from authenticating at a certain time of the day. This type of restriction would not protect a system where the authentication has already occurred.
