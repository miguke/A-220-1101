To restart the print spooler, the\nsalesperson can use the Services app, which allows them to stop and start the service. Alternatively, they can also use the Task Manager or the Command Prompt\nto restart the print spooler.\nReferences and Explanation\n? The Services app is a tool that displays all the services that are running on the\ncomputer. It can be accessed by typing services.msc in the Run window or by searching for Services in the Start menu. The Services app allows users to start,\nstop, restart, or configure any service, including the print spooler123.\n? The Task Manager is a tool that shows information about the processes,\napplications, and services that are running on the computer. It can be accessed by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc or by right-clicking on the taskbar and selecting Task\nManager. The Task Manager allows users to start, stop, or restart any service by going to the Services tab and right-clicking on the service name12.\n? The Command Prompt is a tool that allows users to execute commands and\nperform tasks using text input. It can be accessed by typing cmd in the Run window or by searching for Command Prompt in the Start menu. The Command\nPrompt allows users to start, stop, or restart any service by using the net command with the service name. For example, to restart the print spooler, users can type\nnet stop spooler and then net start spooler1.\n? The Control Panel is a tool that provides access to various settings and options for\nthe computer. It can be accessed by typing control panel in the Run window or by searching for Control Panel in the Start menu. The Control Panel does not allow\nusers to restart the print spooler directly, but it can be used to access other tools such as Devices and Printers, Troubleshooting, or Administrative Tools2.\n? The Processes tab is a part of the Task Manager that shows information about the\nprocesses that are running on the computer. It can be accessed by opening the Task Manager and selecting the Processes tab. The Processes tab does not allow\nusers to restart the print spooler directly, but it can be used to end any process that is related to printing or causing problems with the print spooler2.\n? The Startup tab is a part of the Task Manager that shows information about the\nprograms that run automatically when the computer starts. It can be accessed by opening the Task Manager and selecting the Startup tab. The Startup tab does\nnot allow users to restart the print spooler directly, but it can be used to disable or enable any program that affects printing or interferes with the print spooler2.",

    "explanation": "Calibrating the phone sensors is a step that can troubleshoot the issue of screen not autorotating on a mobile device. Screen autorotation is a feature that\nautomatically adjusts the screen orientation based on the device’s position and movement. Screen autorotation relies on sensors such as accelerometer and\ngyroscope to detect the device’s tilt and rotation. Calibrating the phone sensors can help fix any errors or inaccuracies in the sensor readings that may prevent\nscreen autorotation from working properly. Enabling the touch screen, reinstalling the operating system, and replacing the screen are not steps that should be\ndone next to troubleshoot this issue.",
