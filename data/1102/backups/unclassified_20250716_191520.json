    "question": "An internal audit has found that a server in the DMZ appears to be infected with malware. The malware does not appear to be part of a file in the OS, and the malware is started each time system is started. What type of malware would be MOST likely found on this server?",
    "options": [
      "Trojan",
      "Ransomware",
      "Keylogger",
      "Spyware",
      "Boot sector virus"
    ],
    "correct": [
      4
    ],
    "explanation": "Boot sector virus Some boot sectors can be modified to run malware, so the malicious software is started each time the computer is booted. The Secure Boot features in a modern UEFI BIOS can prevent unsigned software from running malicious software. The incorrect answers: A. Trojan A Trojan horse is malware that pretends to be legitimate software. In this example, there was no mention of specific software running in the operating system. B. Ransomware Ransomware is malware that encrypts all of your personal files and requires a payment, or ransom, to regain access to the data. C. Keylogger A keylogger will store all of the input made from a keyboard and transmit this information to a third-party. The attacker will commonly use these logged keystrokes to gain unauthorized access to other sites. D. Spyware Spyware is a type of malware used to monitor browsing locations, capturing keystrokes, and watching user activity.

    "question": "An organization has been tasked with increasing the minimum password length. A systems administrator has created a policy to require all passwords to be at least ten characters long for all users. When testing this policy in the lab, a laptop computer allowed the creation of eight- character passwords. Which of the following commands should be used to apply this new policy on the laptop?",
    "options": [
      "net use",
      "gpupdate",
      "sfc",
      "tasklist"
    ],
    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "gpupdate The gpupdate (Group Policy Update) command forces centralized updates to be activated on target devices. In this example, the policy was created but the laptop computer had not yet received the new configuration. The incorrect answers: A. net use The net use command assigns Windows shares to local drive letters. The net use command will not process Group Policy changes or modify the password policies on a computer. C. sfc The sfc (System File Checker) utility will scan protected system files to make sure that the core operating system has integrity. The sfc utility will not have any impact on the use of passwords. D. tasklist The Windows tasklist command displays a list of currently running processes on a local or remote machine. Running tasklist will not change any policies related to password complexity.

    "question": "A user runs a corporate app on their smartphone that downloads a database each time the app is started. This download process normally takes a few seconds, but today the download is taking minutes to complete. Which of the following should a technician follow as the best NEXT troubleshooting step?",
    "options": [
      "Disable Bluetooth",
      "Run a network speed check",
      "Charge the smartphone battery",
      "Check the cloud storage resource usage"
    ],
    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "Run a network speed check Delays associated with the download process would initially indicate a problem with the network connection. A speed check would evaluate the network connectivity and provide a baseline for download speeds. The incorrect answers: A. Disable Bluetooth The Bluetooth radio would not cause a delay in transmitting traffic across the 802.11 network or cellular network. It's unlikely that disabling Bluetooth would provide any change to the download speed. C. Charge the smartphone battery Although some smartphone features may be limited when battery life is low, it would not cause the delays associated with the current download issue. D. Check the cloud storage resource usage The resource usage of a cloud storage platform would not be the most likely cause of the delays with this app. More information: 220-1002, Objective 3.5 Troubleshooting Mobile Device Security https://professormesser.link/1102030501 Practice Exam B - Answers 179",
