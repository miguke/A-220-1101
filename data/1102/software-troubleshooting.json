    "explanation": "Calibrating the phone sensors is a step that can troubleshoot the issue of screen not autorotating on a mobile device. Screen autorotation is a feature that\nautomatically adjusts the screen orientation based on the device’s position and movement. Screen autorotation relies on sensors such as accelerometer and\ngyroscope to detect the device’s tilt and rotation. Calibrating the phone sensors can help fix any errors or inaccuracies in the sensor readings that may prevent\nscreen autorotation from working properly. Enabling the touch screen, reinstalling the operating system, and replacing the screen are not steps that should be\ndone next to troubleshoot this issue.",

Scope defines what is\nincluded and excluded in the project or activity, such as goals, requirements, deliverables, tasks and resources. Scope helps determine the feasibility, duration and\ncost of the project or activity. Scope also helps manage the expectations and needs of the stakeholders involved in the project or activity. Purpose is the reason or\nobjective for doing a project or an activity. Purpose defines why the project or activity is important or necessary, such as solving a problem, meeting a need or\nachieving a goal. Purpose helps provide direction, motivation and justification for the project or activity. Analysis is the process of examining, evaluating and\ninterpreting data or information related to a project or an activity. Analysis helps identify, understand and prioritize issues, risks, opportunities and solutions for the\nproject or activity. Impact is the effect or outcome of a project or an activity on something or someone else. Impact defines how the project or activity affects or\ninfluences other factors, such as performance, quality, satisfaction or value. Impact helps measure the success and effectiveness of the project or activity.\nReferences: CompTIA A+ Core 2 (220-1002) Certification Exam Objectives Version 4.0, Domain 5.2",

To remove the malware, it's important the technician is using the latest set of signatures. The incorrect answers: B. Educate the end-user This is one of the most important tasks for malware removal, but it's usually reserved for the final step when there's no longer any urgency to remove the malware. C. Schedule anti-virus scans for midnight each day Once the virus is removed, the system should be configured for on-demand scanning and additional scans each day. However, this would not immediately follow the disabling of System Restore. D. Boot the system with the original installation media Booting into a command line from the original Windows installation media may be required for more difficult virus removal tasks, but this would only occur after the latest anti-virus signatures were downloaded and installed.

    "explanation": "Boot to Safe Mode and use signatures downloaded from a separate computer It's not uncommon for viruses to disable access to recovery software. To work around this issue, a technician may often need to restart in Safe Mode and copy utilities and recovery files from a different computer. The incorrect answers: B. Roll back to a previous configuration Viruses often infect both the current configuration and those contained in restore points. In this case, the System Restore feature has already been disabled, so no restore points would be available on this system. C. Schedule periodic updates and reconnect to the network Since the manual update process is failing, it's most likely an automated update would also fail. D. Discuss anti-virus strategies with the end user Once the virus has been removed and the system is set to automatically update and scan for viruses, the technician can educate the end user about ways to avoid this problem in the future.

None of the other options would provide any mitigation of the potential issue. The incorrect answers: A. Disable the GPS Disabling the GPS (Global Positioning System) might limit the scope of a potential malware infection because the malware would not have location information to share. However, this only addresses the symptom caused by the malware and not the problem of the malware itself. B. Perform a soft reset If this issue was related to malware, then a soft reset would not resolve the issue. Private information sent to a third-party is a significant security concern, so addressing the issue with an anti-malware scan is the best of the available options. D. Use the cellular network instead of Wi-Fi Changing the type of network used for the third-party communication would not limit or stop the sharing of location information.

Scan for viruses and malware Without knowing the root cause of the issue, it will be important to gather as much information about the issue without making any changes to the operating system or applications. A diagnostic would provide information about the health of the hardware, and scanning for viruses would check for any malicious software. Neither of those options would make any changes to the configuration of the system. The incorrect answers: A. Start the computer in Safe Mode Since this issue occurs over time, simply staring the computer in Safe Mode would not provide much information about the issue. C. Connect the computer to a different VLAN The issue does not appear to be related to network connectivity, so choosing a different VLAN for this computer would most likely not result in any change. VLAN assignments don't tend to slow computers down over time, so this would also not be a common solution to the issue. 354 Practice Exam C - Answers D.
