    "explanation": "The ext3 file system is a Linux native file system that meets the requirements of the question. It has the following features:\n? All changes are tracked. The ext3 file system uses a journaling mechanism that\nrecords all changes to the file system metadata in a special log called the journal before applying them to the actual file system. This ensures that the file system\ncan be restored to a consistent state in case of a power failure or system crash12.\n? The possibility of file corruption is reduced. The journaling feature of ext3 also\nreduces the possibility of file corruption, as it avoids the need for a full file system check after an unclean shutdown. The file system can be quickly replayed from\nthe journal and any inconsistencies can be fixed12.\n? Data recovery is easy. The ext3 file system supports undeletion of files using tools\nsuch as ext3grep or extundelete, which can scan the file system for deleted inodes and attempt to recover the data blocks associated with them34.\nReferences:\n1: Introduction to Linux File System [Structure and Types] - MiniTool1 2: 7 Ways to Determine the File System Type in Linux (Ext2, Ext3 or Ext4) - Tecmint3 3:\nHow to Recover Deleted Files in Linux with ext3grep 4: How to Recover Deleted Files from ext3 Partitions",

    "explanation": "NTFS stands for New Technology File System and it is the preferred filesystem for Microsoft Windows OS since Windows NT 3.1 in 19931. NTFS replaced FAT\n(File Allocation Table) as the default filesystem for Windows because it offers many advantages over FAT, such as:\n? Support for larger volumes and files (up to 16 exabytes)2\n?

Support for hard links, symbolic links, and mount points2\n? Support for long filenames and Unicode characters2\nFAT32 is an improved version of FAT that supports larger volumes and files (up to 32 GB and 4 GB respectively) and is compatible with older versions of Windows\nand other operating systems3. However, FAT32 still has many limitations and drawbacks compared\nto NTFS, such as:\n? No support for file compression, encryption, and permissions3\n? No support for journaling, which makes it vulnerable to corruption and data loss3\n? No support for hard links, symbolic links, and mount points3\n? No support for long filenames and Unicode characters3\nAPFS (Apple File System) is the default filesystem for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS since 20174. APFS replaced HFS+ (Hierarchical File System\nPlus) as the preferred filesystem for Apple devices because it offers many advantages over HFS+, such as:\n? Support for larger volumes and files (up to 8 zettabytes)4\n? Support for file cloning, snapshots, and encryption4\n? Support for space sharing, which allows multiple volumes to share the same storage pool4\n? Support for fast directory sizing, which improves performance and efficiency4 ext4 (Fourth Extended Filesystem) is the default filesystem for most Linux\ndistributions since 20085. ext4 replaced ext3 as the preferred filesystem for Linux because it offers many advantages over ext3, such as:\n? Support for larger volumes and files (up to 1 exabyte and 16 terabytes respectively)5\n? Support for extents, which reduce fragmentation and improve performance5\n?

    "explanation": "Windows 10\n100% Valid and Newest Version 220-1102 Questions & Answers shared by Certleader\nThe correct answer is D. Unattended installation. An unattended installation is a way of installing Windows 10 without requiring any user input or interaction. It uses\na configuration file called answer file that contains the settings and preferences for the installation, such as the product key, language, partition, and network\nsettings. An unattended installation can be performed by using a bootable USB flash drive or DVD that contains the Windows 10 installation files and the answer\nfile1. This is the fastest way for the technician to install Windows 10 on a newly built computer, as it automates the whole process and saves time. A factory reset\nis a way of restoring a computer to its original state by deleting all the data and applications and reinstalling the operating system. A factory reset can be performed\nby using the recovery partition or media that came with the computer, or by using the Reset this PC option in Windows 10 settings2. A factory reset is not a way of\ninstalling Windows 10 on a newly built computer, as it requires an existing operating system to be present.\nA system restore is a way of undoing changes to a computerâs system files and settings by using a restore point that was created earlier. A system restore can be\nperformed by using the System Restore option in Windows 10 settings or by using the Advanced Startup Options menu3. A system restore is not a way of\ninstalling Windows 10 on a newly built computer, as it requires an existing operating system and restore points to be present.\nAn in-place upgrade is a way of upgrading an existing operating system to a newer version without losing any data or applications. An in-place upgrade can be\nperformed by using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool or by running the Setup.exe file from the Windows 10 installation media. An in-place upgrade is not a\nway of installing Windows 10 on a newly built computer, as it requires an existing operating system to be present.",

    "explanation": "Disconnected VPN Remote users will commonly connect to the corporate office over a VPN (Virtual Private Network). This VPN is an encrypted tunnel and all traffic between the locations is protected from anyone monitoring the connection. If the VPN link is not active, then the remote user will be unable to use any resources at the corporate office. The incorrect answers: A. WPA3 settings WPA3 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 3) is a standard for wireless encryption and security. WPA3 would not be involved in a printing problem across a VPN to a corporate office. B. Outdated anti-virus signatures Anti-virus signatures would not commonly restrict the printing process, and the age of the signatures would only affect the ability of the anti-virus software to block known viruses. D. MDM configuration An MDM (Mobile Device Manager) is used to manage mobile tablets and phones. MDM configurations would not commonly have an impact on home users connecting to a corporate printer.

It's common to run the sfc utility after removing malware or after a significant operating system issue. The incorrect answers: A. gpupdate The gpupdate (Group Policy Update) command is used to force a Group Policy update to computers in a Windows Active Directory domain. The gpupdate command would not restore any missing operating system files. B. winver The winver (Windows Version) command line utility will display the \"About Windows\" dialog box on the screen.

A filename named \"Monthly Orders\" might be a spreadsheet, or it could be an executable containing a virus. The incorrect answers: A. Always show icons, never thumbnails Showing icons instead of thumbnails can still be a way to hide information. For example, it's relatively easy to create an executable that uses the same icon as a spreadsheet. B. Display the full path in the title bar The full path in the title bar shows where the file is located on the volume, but it doesn't provide any information about the contents of the file. C.

Repair installation A repair installation does not upgrade an operating system, and it usually requires intervention on each system to complete the repair process. D.

Although disabling the paging file may affect the performance of a computer, it will free up all of the storage space that's normally reserved for the swap file. The incorrect answers: A. Use a Guest login The type of login used on a computer does not generally affect the amount of free storage space on the computer. B. Enable System Protection The Windows System Protection feature will set restore points and save files and configurations to the storage drive.
