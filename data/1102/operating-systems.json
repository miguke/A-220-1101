    "explanation": "The ext3 file system is a Linux native file system that meets the requirements of the question. It has the following features:\n? All changes are tracked. The ext3 file system uses a journaling mechanism that\nrecords all changes to the file system metadata in a special log called the journal before applying them to the actual file system. This ensures that the file system\ncan be restored to a consistent state in case of a power failure or system crash12.\n? The possibility of file corruption is reduced. The journaling feature of ext3 also\nreduces the possibility of file corruption, as it avoids the need for a full file system check after an unclean shutdown. The file system can be quickly replayed from\nthe journal and any inconsistencies can be fixed12.\n? Data recovery is easy. The ext3 file system supports undeletion of files using tools\nsuch as ext3grep or extundelete, which can scan the file system for deleted inodes and attempt to recover the data blocks associated with them34.\nReferences:\n1: Introduction to Linux File System [Structure and Types] - MiniTool1 2: 7 Ways to Determine the File System Type in Linux (Ext2, Ext3 or Ext4) - Tecmint3 3:\nHow to Recover Deleted Files in Linux with ext3grep 4: How to Recover Deleted Files from ext3 Partitions",

    "explanation": "NTFS stands for New Technology File System and it is the preferred filesystem for Microsoft Windows OS since Windows NT 3.1 in 19931. NTFS replaced FAT\n(File Allocation Table) as the default filesystem for Windows because it offers many advantages over FAT, such as:\n? Support for larger volumes and files (up to 16 exabytes)2\n?

Support for hard links, symbolic links, and mount points2\n? Support for long filenames and Unicode characters2\nFAT32 is an improved version of FAT that supports larger volumes and files (up to 32 GB and 4 GB respectively) and is compatible with older versions of Windows\nand other operating systems3. However, FAT32 still has many limitations and drawbacks compared\nto NTFS, such as:\n? No support for file compression, encryption, and permissions3\n? No support for journaling, which makes it vulnerable to corruption and data loss3\n? No support for hard links, symbolic links, and mount points3\n? No support for long filenames and Unicode characters3\nAPFS (Apple File System) is the default filesystem for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS since 20174. APFS replaced HFS+ (Hierarchical File System\nPlus) as the preferred filesystem for Apple devices because it offers many advantages over HFS+, such as:\n? Support for larger volumes and files (up to 8 zettabytes)4\n? Support for file cloning, snapshots, and encryption4\n? Support for space sharing, which allows multiple volumes to share the same storage pool4\n? Support for fast directory sizing, which improves performance and efficiency4 ext4 (Fourth Extended Filesystem) is the default filesystem for most Linux\ndistributions since 20085. ext4 replaced ext3 as the preferred filesystem for Linux because it offers many advantages over ext3, such as:\n? Support for larger volumes and files (up to 1 exabyte and 16 terabytes respectively)5\n? Support for extents, which reduce fragmentation and improve performance5\n?
