Malware is typically\ndistributed via email attachments, fake internet ads, infected applications or websites, and often relies on user interaction to execute6. Therefore, one of the most\neffective ways to prevent malware infections is to educate the end user about the common signs and sources of malware, and how to avoid them7.

Port 445 is used by SMB to communicate directly over TCP without the need for NetBIOS, which is an older and less secure\nprotocol.

The firewall settings may be blocking or preventing the access to the\ninternal site by mistake or by default, especially if the site uses a non-standard port number such as 8888. The technician should check and modify the firewall\nsettings to allow the access to the internal site or its port number. Default gateway settings determine how a computer connects to other networks or the internet.\nDefault gateway settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access the public internet. DHCP settings\ndetermine how a computer obtains its IP address and other network configuration parameters automatically from a DHCP server. DHCP settings are not likely to\ncause the issue of not being able to access an internal site if the user can access other network resources. IP address settings determine how a computer\nidentifies itself and communicates with other devices on a network. IP address settings are not likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site\nif the user can access other network resources. Antivirus settings control how the antivirus software scans and protects the computer from malware and threats.\nAntivirus settings are less likely to cause the issue of not being able to access an internal site than firewall settings, unless the antivirus software has its own\nfirewall feature that may interfere with the network traffic.

This will remove the jailbreak and any\nunauthorized or malicious apps that may have been installed on the device, as well as restore the security features and policies that the company has set for its\ndevices. This will also ensure that the device can receive the latest updates and patches from the manufacturer and the company, and prevent any data leakage or\ncompromise from the device.\nJailbreaking is a process of bypassing the built-in security features of a device to install software other than what the manufacturer has made available for that\ndevice1. Jailbreaking allows the device owner to gain full access to the root of the operating system and access all the features1. However, jailbreaking also\nexposes the device to various risks, such as:\n? The loss of warranty from the device manufacturers2.\n? Inability to update software until a jailbroken version becomes available2.\n? Increased security vulnerabilities32.\n? Decreased battery life2.\n? Increased volatility of the device2.\nSome of the signs of a jailbroken device are:\n? A high number of ads, which may indicate the presence of adware or spyware on the device3.\n? Receiving data-usage limit notifications, which may indicate the device is sending or receiving data in the background without the user\u2019s knowledge or consent3.\n? Experiencing slow response, which may indicate the device is running unauthorized or malicious apps that consume resources or interfere with the normal\nfunctioning of the device3.\n? Finding apps or icons that the user did not install or recognize, such as Cydia, which is a storefront for jailbroken iOS devices1.\nThe other options are not sufficient or appropriate for dealing with a jailbroken device. Running an antivirus and enabling encryption may not detect or remove all\nthe threats or vulnerabilities that the jailbreak has introduced, and may not restore the device to its original state or functionality. Backing up the files and doing a\nsystem restore may not erase the jailbreak or the unauthorized apps, and may also backup the infected or compromised files. Undoing the jailbreak and enabling\nan antivirus may not be possible or effective, as the jailbreak may prevent the device from updating or installing security software, and may also leave traces of the\njailbreak or the unauthorized apps on the device.\nReferences:\n?

        "explanation": "Low-level wiping is the best data destruction method for recycling old hard drives for reuse. Low-level wiping is a process that overwrites every bit of data on a\ndrive with zeros or random patterns, making it impossible to recover any data from the drive. Low-level wiping also restores the\nhard\ndrive to its factory state, removing any bad sectors or errors that may have accumulated over time. Low-level wiping can be done using specialized software tools\nor hardware devices that connect to the drive. Degaussing, standard formatting, and deleting are not suitable data destruction methods for recycling old hard\ndrives for reuse. Degaussing is a process that exposes a hard drive to a strong magnetic field, destroying both the data and the drive itself. Degaussing renders\nthe drive unusable for reuse. Standard formatting is a process that erases the data on a hard drive by removing the file system structure, but it does not overwrite\nthe data itself. Standard formatting leaves some data recoverable using forensic tools or software utilities. Deleting is a process that removes the data from a hard\ndrive by marking it as free space, but it does not erase or overwrite the data itself. Deleting leaves most data recoverable using undelete tools or software utilities.\nReferences:\n? Official CompTIA learning resources CompTIA A+ Core 1 and Core 2, page 15\n?

Disable any file-sharing or remote access services on the system, such as Windows File Sharing, Remote Desktop, or TeamViewer.\n?

Transfer the updated antivirus software and tools to the infected system using a removable media, such as a CD, DVD, or USB flash drive. Scan the removable\nmedia for any infections before and after using it on the infected system.\n? Run the antivirus software and tools on the infected system and follow the instructions to delete or quarantine the infection. If the infection is persistent or\ncomplex, it may require booting the system from a rescue disk or using a Linux live disc to access and clean the system files.\n?
