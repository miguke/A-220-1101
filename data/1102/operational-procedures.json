If the end user feels that the issue is time-sensitive, then it's important to contact them and see what options might be available to get them up and running as quickly as possible. The incorrect answers: A. Place the ticket into the queue as first-come, first-served Not all support tickets have the same priority, and it's the responsibility of the technician to properly triage the cases with the most critical first. It will usually involve some communication with the client to determine the scope of the issue. B. Prioritize the support tickets by device type The urgency of a technical issue isn't determined by the type of the device. Instead, the priority of issues should be based on the needs of the end user and the importance of their task. C. Triage the queue and prioritize the tickets in order of repair complexity The complexity of a repair doesn't consider the importance of the repair to the organization's goals and objectives.

Upgrade file availability Since the upgrade plan was already written, it's most likely that all of the upgrade files were in place and ready. C. Not enough time to complete the upgrade This question didn't define a specific timeframe for completion, although it's common to complete changes during a weekend. D. Need more people for the upgrade process The question didn't define any personnel requirements, so there did not appear to be any constraints on the availability of personnel.

    "question": "A user has dropped off their laptop at the repair desk. A message taped to the laptop states: \"Doesn't work.\" Which of the following would be the BEST next step?",
    "options": [
      "Start the laptop and look for any issues",

      1

    "explanation": "Call the customer and ask for more information A problem report of \"Doesn't work\" does not provide enough information to begin troubleshooting. A quick call to the customer will allow the technician to ask more specific questions and ultimately will resolve the laptop problem faster. The incorrect answers: A. Start the laptop and look for any issues There's no way to know what part of the laptop is having problems, so blindly stumbling through possible issues would not be the most efficient way to troubleshoot this issue. C. Replace the power adapter and try booting the laptop There's no evidence that the laptop's power adapter is faulty. Replacing hardware without knowing more about the problem would not be the best next troubleshooting step. D. Use a diagnostics boot CD to run hardware tests. Many hardware diagnostics disks use bootable media, but there's no way to know if the reported issue was hardware-related. Taking time to run a hardware diagnostics test would not be the most efficient troubleshooting step.

    "explanation": "Create a file-level backup each day Given the available options, the best way to create a separate version of every file each day will be to perform a file-level backup every 24 hours. The incorrect answers: B. Maintain a monthly image level backup A monthly backup that images the entire computer does not provide a method to restore daily versions of a document. C. Store full backup tapes at an off-site facility Although full backups would provide a method of restoring document versions, maintaining those backups at an off-site facility would cause delays in the restoration of those documents. D. Assign each user a USB flash drive Requiring the users to maintain their own backup media would not be the best way to implement this requirement.

If a person in the organization is not following the terms of the AUP, then the security officer's team should manage the results of that action. The incorrect answers: A. Create a firewall filter to block the website A firewall filter may successfully prevent the user from visiting the site, but the original problem of the user browsing to the site still exists. Creating a firewall filter might be an eventual result of this situation, but it would not be the best next step. B. Scan all computers with the latest anti-malware signatures There's nothing in this example that would indicate that the inappropriate website was a security risk or that the end user's computer was infected with malware. D. Change the user’s password Locking out the user by changing their password might cause other issues that are outside the scope of the AUP violation.

Foam A water-based foam extinguisher would not be a good choice for electrical equipment. C. Saline Any water-based extinguisher, especially one with salt, would be a very bad choice for a data center. D. Water Water is commonly used in fire extinguishers, but a data center and the large amount of powered electronics in a single room requires an extinguisher that can be used safely while putting out the fire.

    "explanation": "Send the call to voicemail and apologize for the interruption When actively working on a problem with a customer, it's important to avoid interruptions, distractions, and anything else that would change focus from the current task. The incorrect answers: A. Take the call and address the caller's requests before continuing It would be unprofessional to allow a phone call to interrupt the current troubleshooting tasks. All calls should be sent to voice mail and can be returned after the customer interaction is complete. B. Take the call and ask the caller if you can return their call later It's not necessary to take a phone call to simply tell the caller they will receive a return call. Instead of interrupting the current customer interaction, it's more professional to send the calls to voice mail. D. Politely excuse yourself and step out to take the call The primary focus of a customer visit is to solve the customer's problems and not to take calls from others. It would be more professional to send the call to voice mail and continue working on the current task.

The data currently stored on the workstation should not be modified in any way. The incorrect answers: A. Create documentation of the storage area Documenting the storage area would not be the most important part of the incident response process. If documentation is needed later, it can be created at that time. B. Retrieve logs from the workstation Event Viewer The workstation has been powered off and locked away to avoid changing any data on the storage drives.

    "explanation": "Ask an associate in the department for assistance The technician has a job to complete, but privacy and access to sensitive information is an important consideration. In these situations, it's best to work with others to remove any of these concerns from the work area. The incorrect answers: A. Complete the repair as quickly as possible The issue with this repair isn't about how quickly the job can be completed, but instead is about the type of data the technician can see. To avoid any issues, it would be best to have a trusted third-party remove the sensitive information from the area. C. Move the papers somewhere out of sight Moving any papers, especially papers containing sensitive information, would not be a good idea. If the technician touches the papers, then they effectively have access to all of the information on the documents. A third-party in the department can move things to create a proper work environment for the repair. D. Leave without repairing the computer The user would prefer that their computer repair was completed, and the technician is already on-site and at their desk. Asking someone else in the department to clean the work area would only take a moment and would allow the repair process to continue.

    "question": "A company has recently been the victim of a storm with large-scale flooding, and all systems and backups at the corporate data center were completely destroyed. Which of the following would be the BEST way to avoid this loss of data in the future?",
    "options": [
      "Battery backup",
      "Cloud storage",
      "RADIUS administration servers",
      "Image-level backups"
    ],
    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "Cloud storage Cloud storage would provide a separate, off-site storage of backups, files, and other important documents. One significant advantage of any off-site backup or storage is to have access to the data if the primary site was to have any type of disaster. The incorrect answers: A. Battery backup Battery backup such as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) would provide a backup power source if the primary power was to become unavailable. A UPS would not provide any method of data backup or data recovery. C. RADIUS administration servers RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) servers authenticate login processes to a centralized user database. In the case of a disaster, users would still be able to login to their important services using these authentication technologies. RADIUS does not provide any data backup or data recovery features, however. D. Image-level backups An image-level backup can be an important part of a backup strategy, but simply performing the image-level backup won't be helpful if the backup services are destroyed during a natural disaster. In this example, having an off-site backup data source would have prevented the data loss.

The incorrect answers: A. Personal licenses A personal license is usually associated with an individual or home-based use of software. Individual personal licenses might be appropriate for smaller groups of users, but larger licensing agreements are required when purchasing for an entire organization. C. Open-source license An open-source license does not commonly require any payment, so there isn't usually a commercial component or financial arrangement associated with the use of open-source licensing. D. End user licensing agreement An end user licensing agreement (EULA) is a list of the licensing terms associated with the use of software.

    "explanation": "Helps prevent identity theft PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is any information that can identify an individual. This information can be an address, phone number, or date of birth. Encrypting PII will help prevent the unintended release of personal data and would assist with preventing identity theft. The incorrect answers: B. Improves application performance The process of encrypting and decrypting data adds more overhead to the data storage process. Although application performance may not become any worse, the encryption process would not commonly improve performance. C. Allows customer data to be easily deleted The removal of customer data is not made easier through the use of encryption. Although it's useful to have processes to remove user information, that process is managed in conjunction with the encryption and decryption process. D. Uses less storage space The encryption process would not commonly be used as a way to decrease the use of storage space. If encryption and decryption is being used, there is most likely a security focus for implementing such a process.

Rechargeable batteries are fire hazards and can leak chemicals, so it's important to handle them properly. C. Ship them to a battery wholesaler A company selling batteries does not necessarily handle the disposal of batteries. The batteries should be delivered to the local hazardous waste facility. D.
