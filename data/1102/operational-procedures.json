        "explanation": "Chain of custody is a process that documents how evidence is collected, handled, stored and transferred during a cybercrime investigation. It ensures that the\nevidence is authentic, reliable and admissible in court. If the chain of custody is violated during an investigation, it can compromise the integrity of the evidence and\nlead to the case being dismissed. Open-source software, EULA (end-user license agreement) and AUP (acceptable use policy) are not related to cybercrime\ninvestigations or evidence handling.

        "explanation": "A synthetic backup is a backup type that provides a backup for all data on the system while providing the lowest impact to the network. It combines a full backup\nwith one or more incremental backups to create a single backup set, without requiring access to the original data source. Off-site is a backup location, not a\nbackup type. Full and differential are backup types, but they have a higher impact on the network than synthetic.

        "explanation": "An ESD strap, also known as an antistatic wrist strap, is a device that prevents electrostatic discharge (ESD) from damaging sensitive electronic components such\nas RAM. ESD is the sudden flow of electricity between two objects with different electrical charges, which can cause permanent damage or malfunction to\nelectronic devices. An ESD strap connects the technician\u2019s wrist to a grounded surface, such as a metal case or a mat, and equalizes the electrical potential\nbetween the technician and the device. Battery backup, thermal paste, and consistent power are not devices that can protect against ESD.",
