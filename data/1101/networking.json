    "explanation": "It is common for companies to place a data cap on the devices they provide to their employees, to control costs. If a user has exceeded the data cap, the phone\nmay no longer allow internet browsing over a cellular connection. This is usually because the cellular data usage has exceeded the allotted amount for the\nparticular plan the device is on, and the service provider has temporarily suspended the data connection.\nIt is unlikely that the child accidentally connected to a neighbor's WLAN because this would not affect the cellular data connection. Similarly, it is unlikely that the\ncompany's group policy has disabled the device, as this would likely affect all devices under the same policy. If the device's plan has been unpaid, the service\nprovider would likely temporarily suspend all services, not just the cellular data connection.\nReference: CompTIA A+ Core 1 Exam Guide, page 329.",

    "explanation": "Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the most appropriate protocol to use for inventory tracking in a small warehouse. RFID is a technology that uses radio\nwaves to identify and track objects that have RFID tags attached to them. RFID tags are small devices that store information about the object, such as its name,\nserial number, location, or status. RFID tags can be passive, which means they do not have a battery and rely on the radio signal from the reader to power them,\nor active, which means they have a battery and can transmit their own signal. RFID readers are devices that can scan the RFID tags and read the information\nstored on them.\nRFID is suitable for inventory tracking in a small warehouse because it can provide several benefits, such as:\n? Faster and more accurate scanning: RFID tags can be scanned without direct line\nof sight, unlike barcodes, and can be scanned in bulk, unlike QR codes. This means that RFID readers can scan multiple items at once, even if they are inside\nboxes or containers, and reduce the time and errors involved in manual scanning.\n? Real-time visibility and control: RFID tags can be updated with the latest\ninformation about the inventory, such as its location, quantity, or condition. This means that RFID readers can provide real-time data and feedback on the inventory\nstatus, such as its availability, movement, or expiration. This can help improve inventory management, optimize warehouse space, and prevent stockouts or\noverstocking.\n? Enhanced security and quality: RFID tags can be encrypted and authenticated,\nunlike barcodes or QR codes, which can be easily copied or tampered with. This means that RFID tags can prevent unauthorized access or theft of the inventory,\nand ensure its authenticity and quality. This can help protect the inventory from damage, loss, or fraud, and increase customer satisfaction and trust.\nReferences:\n?

    "explanation": "The correct answer is C. Cat 6.\nAn RJ45 connector is a standard type of physical connector for network cables. RJ45 connectors are used almost exclusively with Ethernet cables and\nnetworking1. Ethernet cables are twisted pair cables that carry data signals between devices on a network, such as computers, routers, switches, and servers2.\nThere are different categories of Ethernet cables, such as Cat 5, Cat 5e, Cat 6, and Cat 7, that have different specifications and performance levels. Cat 6 is one of\nthe most common types of Ethernet cables, which supports data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps and bandwidth up to 250 MHz3. Cat 6 cables have four pairs of\ncopper wires, each with a plastic insulation and a foil or braided shield. The wires are twisted together to reduce crosstalk and interference4.\nTo terminate a Cat 6 cable, an administrator needs to use an RJ45 connector that matches the wiring scheme of the cable. There are two common wiring schemes\nfor Ethernet cables: T568A and T568B. The administrator needs to strip the cable jacket, untwist the wires, arrange them in the correct order according to the\nchosen scheme, trim the excess wire, and insert them into the RJ45 connector. Then, the administrator needs to use a crimping tool to secure the wires and the\nconnector4.\nOptical cables are not terminated with RJ45 connectors, but with different types of connectors that can transmit light signals, such as SC, ST, LC, or MTRJ\nconnectors. Optical cables are used for fiber-optic networks that can carry data over long distances at high speeds.\nSerial cables are not terminated with RJ45 connectors, but with different types of connectors that can transmit serial data signals, such as DB9, DB25, or DE9\nconnectors. Serial cables are used for connecting devices that use serial communication protocols, such as modems, printers, scanners, or keyboards.\nUSB cables are not terminated with RJ45 connectors, but with different types of connectors that can transmit universal serial bus data signals, such as USB-A,\nUSB-B, USB-C, or Micro-USB connectors. USB cables are used for connecting devices that use USB communication protocols, such as flash drives, cameras,\nmice, or chargers.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Access point.\nAn access point is a device that extends the wireless coverage of a network by creating a hotspot that allows wireless devices to connect to the network1. An\naccess point can be connected to a router or a switch via an Ethernet cable or a wireless bridge1. By deploying one or more access points throughout a SOHO\nlocation, the technician can provide better wireless connectivity and eliminate dead zones or weak signals2.\nA managed switch is a device that allows multiple devices to communicate on a network by forwarding data packets based on their destination addresses3. A\nmanaged switch can also provide advanced features such as VLANs, QoS, security, and remote management3. However, a managed switch does not improve\nwireless connectivity, as it only works with wired devices.\nA POE hub is a device that provides power and data over a single Ethernet cable to devices that support Power over Ethernet (PoE) technology, such as IP\ncameras, VoIP phones, and wireless access points4. A POE hub can simplify the installation and placement of these devices by eliminating the need for separate\npower adapters or outlets4. However, a POE hub does not improve wireless connectivity by itself, as it still requires an access point or a router to create a wireless\nnetwork.\nA Wi-Fi router is a device that combines the functions of a router and an access point, providing both wired and wireless connectivity to a network and the internet.\nA Wi-Fi router can be used to create a SOHO network, but it may not be sufficient to cover the entire location with a strong and reliable wireless signal. To improve\nwireless connectivity, the technician may need to add additional access points or use a mesh Wi-Fi system that consists of multiple routers that work together to\ncreate a seamless wireless network. Therefore, an access point is the best option among the choices to improve wireless connectivity throughout a SOHO\nlocation.",

A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel\nbetween the user’s device and the VPN server, which acts as a gateway to the network. The user can then access the network resources as if they were directly\nconnected to the network, without exposing their traffic to eavesdropping, interception, or censorship.\nA VPN can provide remote users with access to various services on a company network, such as file and print services, client/server applications, and remote\nnetwork administration1. A VPN can also protect the user’s privacy and identity online by masking their IP address and location.\nReferences:\n•Remote Access to a Network - NETWORK ENCYCLOPEDIA, section “Remote access typically gives remote users access to the following services on a\ncompany network”.",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is D. Cat 6a.\nCat 6a (augmented) is a type of twisted pair cable that supports 10GBASE-T data transmission speed. 10GBASE-T is an Ethernet standard that can deliver 10\ngigabits per second (Gbps) over copper cables. Cat 6a can support this speed up to a distance of 100 meters, which is the same as Cat 5e and Cat 6 for lower\nspeeds. Cat 6a has better shielding and crosstalk prevention than Cat 6, which makes it more suitable for high- frequency signals.\nCat 3, Cat 5, and Cat 5e are not capable of supporting 10GBASE-T data transmission speed. Cat 3 can only support up to 10 Mbps, Cat 5 can only support up to\n100 Mbps, and Cat 5e can only support up to 1 Gbps. These cables have lower bandwidth, higher attenuation, and more interference than Cat 6a.\nReference: Network Cables - CompTIA A+ 220-1101 - 3.1 - Professor Messer IT Certification Training Courses",

    "explanation": "The correct answer is A. Serial.\nA serial cable is a type of cable that can be used to connect a laptop to a network device via a serial port. A serial port is a physical interface that allows data\ntransmission between devices using serial communication, which is a method of sending data one bit at a time over a single wire. Serial ports are often used for\nconsole access to network devices, such as routers, switches, firewalls, or servers, when other methods of connection, such as SSH (Secure Shell), are not\navailable or not working.\nSSH is a protocol that allows secure and encrypted remote login and command execution over a network. SSH uses public key cryptography to authenticate the\nclient and the server, and to encrypt the data exchanged between them. SSH can be accessed through different ports, depending on the configuration of the\nserver and the client. The default port for SSH is 22, but it can be changed to any other port for security reasons.\nHDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) is a type of cable that can be used to transmit audio and video signals between devices, such as laptops, monitors,\nTVs, or projectors. HDMI cables support high-definition video and audio formats, and can also carry Ethernet and power signals. HDMI cables are not suitable for\nconnecting to network devices via SSH, as they are designed for multimedia purposes.\nParallel cables are a type of cable that can be used to connect devices that use parallel communication, which is a method of sending data multiple bits at a time\nover multiple wires. Parallel cables are often used for connecting printers or scanners to computers, but they are not commonly used for network devices or SSH\nconnections.\nLightning cables are a type of cable that can be used to connect Apple devices, such as iPhones, iPads, or iPods, to computers or chargers. Lightning cables\nsupport data transfer and power delivery, and can also be used with adapters to connect to other types of ports, such as USB or HDMI. Lightning cables are not\ncompatible with network devices or SSH connections, as they are specific to Apple products.\nTherefore, the only cable that can be used as an alternative connection method with a laptop when SSH is not working is a serial cable. Serial cables can provide\nconsole access to network devices and allow configuration and troubleshooting commands to be executed. For more information about SSH and its alternatives,\nyou can refer to the following web search results: Alternatives to SSH, How To Configure Custom Connection Options for your SSH Client, Understanding the SSH\nEncryption and Connection Process, How to Use Public Key Authentication with SSH.",
