If a user has exceeded the data cap, the phone\nmay no longer allow internet browsing over a cellular connection. This is usually because the cellular data usage has exceeded the allotted amount for the\nparticular plan the device is on, and the service provider has temporarily suspended the data connection.\nIt is unlikely that the child accidentally connected to a neighbor's WLAN because this would not affect the cellular data connection. Similarly, it is unlikely that the\ncompany's group policy has disabled the device, as this would likely affect all devices under the same policy. If the device's plan has been unpaid, the service\nprovider would likely temporarily suspend all services, not just the cellular data connection.\nReference: CompTIA A+ Core 1 Exam Guide, page 329.",

    "explanation": "A router (option C) is a network device that is used to separate broadcast domains. A broadcast domain is a logical division of a computer network in which all\nnodes can reach each other by broadcast at the data link layer. Routers operate at the network layer of the OSI model and use routing tables to determine the best\npath for forwarding packets between different networks.\nBy separating broadcast domains, routers can help to reduce network congestion and improve performance. When a router receives a broadcast packet on one of\nits interfaces, it does not forward the packet to any other interfaces. This means that only devices within the same broadcast domain as the sender will receive the\nbroadcast packet.",
