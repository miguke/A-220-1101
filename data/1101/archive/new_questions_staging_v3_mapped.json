    "question": "A company issues their sales team smartphones under a CYOD policy. A salesperson decides to watch a film on Netflix when staying at a hotel because it is cheaper than subscribing to the hotel’s video packages. After breakfast, they use their smartphone to find directions to the next customer’s site, but the internet is not working. What is the most likely reason that the internet is not available?",

    "explanation": "Most companies have a data cap on their mobile devices and wireless routers that need to be topped up once the limit has been reached. All other answers are incorrect. Network coverage must be available in the area as the salesperson was able to watch a movie online the previous evening. MDM solutions test updates prior to releasing them. Companies are highly unlikely to miss mobile phone payments as they are critical to business operations.",

    "explanation": "The charging stage involves applying a uniform charge to the photosensitive drum using a corona wire. This prepares the drum for the next step in the printing process. In the exposing stage, a laser beam or LED light source is used to selectively discharge the charged areas on the drum, creating an electrostatic image of the printed content. During the developing stage, toner particles are attracted to the areas of the drum that have been discharged, forming a visible image on the drum’s surface. The transferring stage involves transferring the toner image from the drum onto the paper or another media. An electric field is applied to pull the toner from the drum onto the paper, resulting in the image being transferred. In the fusing stage, heat and pressure are applied to melt and bond the toner particles onto the paper, creating a permanent image. This is typically done using a fuser assembly that contains heated rollers. After each printing cycle, the cleaning stage ensures that any residual toner or debris is removed from the drum surface. This is important to maintain print quality and prevent contamination of subsequent printouts.",

This helps prevent overheating and ensures optimal performance and longevity of the hardware. Display resolution is unrelated to cooling fans. Wireless connectivity is achieved through other components, such as network adapters. Cooling fans do not impact sound quality.",

All other answers are incorrect. When setting up the touchscreen, a digitizer is installed. At the time of this installation, the technician must ensure that there are no air bubbles. However, as the screen was working previously (i.e., after its initial installation), air bubbles beneath the glass are not likely to be the current problem. The display settings affect the screen, not the touchscreen itself. A touchscreen only needs between 0.1 and 2 watts; it is a very low-power aspect of the device.",

    "explanation": "When a monitor shows either pink or purple discoloration, it is probably caused by a faulty or loose cable. Display burn-in shows a ghost image of the previous image on the screen. The color here covers the whole screen. A faulty graphics card will show a flickering screen but, in this instance, there is no flickering screen. A burned-out bulb will cause the screen to be dim.",

    "explanation": "When the cursor keeps drifting, then you need to calibrate the screen to fix it. A discolored screen would be a video cable problem. There is no mention of a graphics driver update; therefore, rolling back the driver is not an option. Changing the screen resolution will not fix this problem; it will merely change the size of the screen.",

    "question": "The plasma screen in a conference room is displaying an image for about 60 seconds after it is shown on the screen. The presenter is using a presentation that is stored on their laptop via an HDMI cable. Which of the following is causing this issue?",

      0
    ],
    "explanation": "Display burn-in is where the previous image remains on the screen or is shown as a ghost image. Dead pixels are where the screen may freeze, and black areas might be visible. A faulty cable would flicker. The laptop freezing could end up with a “no-signal” error.",

    "options": [
      "To ensure accurate color representation",

      "To verify compatibility with different display devices",

    "correct": [
      2
    ],
    "explanation": "Testing the output resolution is primarily done to ensure that the system’s output is compatible with a variety of display devices. Display devices can have different resolutions and capabilities, and testing helps confirm that the system can adapt to and function properly with these devices. It ensures that the output is correctly scaled, aligned, and compatible, avoiding issues such as distorted images or cut-off content. The accuracy of color representation and optimization of image quality are secondary considerations, but the main focus is on compatibility with various display devices. It does not enhance system performance.",

      2
    ],
    "explanation": "The display settings is the correct answer as the display settings often include options for touch-screen calibration and enabling touch input. The battery status is incorrect as the battery status does not have a direct impact on touch-screen functionality. The network connection is incorrect as the network connection does not affect touch-screen functionality. The keyboard settings is incorrect as keyboard settings do not directly relate to touch-screen functionality.",
