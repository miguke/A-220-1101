An insufficient fuser temperature typically causes issues such as toner smearing or incomplete bonding, but it does not directly relate to the appearance of a ghost image on the printed page. Low toner levels may result in faded or light printouts. A loose connection between the printer and the computer may lead to communication issues or prevent print jobs from being processed.",

Using tweezers or pliers could potentially damage the fuser or other printer components, so it is not recommended. If the paper gets stuck to the fuser in a newly installed printer, turn off the printer and allow it to cool down. Instead of removing the paper yourself, consult the printer’s manual or contact the manufacturer for specific instructions.
