    "question": "An IT manager discovered that hundreds of pages of printed materials are being recycled each day because the materials are left on the printer tray instead of\nbeing picked up by users. Which of the following would BEST prevent this waste?",
    "options": [
      "Send friendly reminders to not print unnecessarily.",
      "Enable duplex printing to reduce paper utilization.",

      3
    ],
    "explanation": "By requiring a code or badge before releasing a print job, it ensures that only authorized personnel can collect the printouts. This method is effective in preventing\nwaste and in keeping sensitive documents confidential. Sending reminders, enabling duplex printing, and billing departments are useful strategies for reducing\npaper utilization but may not necessarily prevent waste caused by uncollected printouts.\nRequiring a code or badge before releasing a print job is the best solution to prevent the waste of printed materials, as it ensures that only the user who initiated\nthe print job is able to pick up the printed materials. This can be achieved by implementing print release software or requiring users to enter a PIN code at the\nprinter. References: CompTIA A+ Certification Exam Objectives 1001, 2.10",
