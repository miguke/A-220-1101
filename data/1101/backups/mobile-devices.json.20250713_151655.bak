A mobile authenticator application is a software program that runs on a smartphone or tablet and generates a one-time\ncode or token that the user can enter along with their password to access a system.

A USB\nconnection is a digital interface that can transfer both power and data between devices using a standard cable. A USB headset can plug into any available USB\nport on the laptop and communicate with the audio and microphone drivers without requiring additional software or hardware. A USB headset can also offer\nenhanced features, such as inline controls, noise cancellation, surround sound, or LED lighting, depending on the model and manufacturer.\nOther connections, such as Bluetooth, DVI, or Thunderbolt, are not appropriate for a headset that can be physically connected to a laptop. Bluetooth is a wireless\ntechnology that uses radio waves to pair devices over a short distance, and it requires a battery or a charger for the headset. DVI (digital visual interface) is a video\ninterface that can transmit digital or analog signals between a display device and a video source, and it is not compatible with audio or microphone devices.\nThunderbolt is a high-speed interface that can support multiple protocols, such as DisplayPort, USB, or PCI Express, and it requires a special cable and port that\nmay not be available on all laptops.\nReferences:\n?

The best way to remove the lint is to give it a good blast of compressed air. All other answers are incorrect. You should not blow into the port as your breath contains moisture that could damage the electrical components. You should never use WD-40 as it is a liquid and spraying electrical components is an electrical hazard. When it dries it leaves an oily residue.
