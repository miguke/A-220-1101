    "question": "A help desk team lead contacts a systems administrator because the technicians are unable to log in to a Linux server that is used to access tools. When the administrator tries to use remote desktop to log in to the server, the administrator sees the GUI is crashing. Which of the following methods can the administrator use to troubleshoot the server effectively?",

    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "SSH is the correct answer because it allows for secure remote access to the Linux server, enabling the administrator to troubleshoot the issue without relying on the GUI. SSH provides a command-line interface to the server, allowing the administrator to diagnose and fix problems even if the GUI is not functioning. SFTP is used for secure file transfers, VNC is a remote desktop protocol that may not work if the GUI is crashing, and MSRA is a remote assistance tool that may not be suitable for troubleshooting a server.",

In File Explorer, you can right-click on a file, select Properties, and check the 'Hidden' attribute to hide the file from normal view. This prevents accidental deletion by making the file invisible unless 'Show hidden files' is enabled in folder options.
