    "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Using disk-wiping software. Using disk-wiping software is the most secure method for removing information from past users' hard drives before reuse. Disk-wiping software performs multiple passes of overwriting data with random patterns, making it virtually impossible to recover the original information. Reinstalling Windows, performing a quick format, or deleting files from command line only remove file system references but leave the actual data intact on the drive, which can be recovered using data recovery tools. For secure data destruction, specialized disk-wiping software is essential.",

When a user experiences high network utilization and repeated security warnings after installing a performance optimization app, the first step should be to uninstall the fraudulent application. These symptoms indicate the app is likely malware or a potentially unwanted program (PUP) that is consuming network resources and triggering security alerts. Uninstalling the suspicious application addresses the root cause directly. Factory reset is too extreme as a first step, increasing data plan limits won't solve the security issue, and disabling mobile hotspot doesn't address the underlying malware problem.",

When both a new laptop and old desktop receive 'address already in use' messages for specialized software requiring a specifically allocated address, the issue is an IP address conflict. The desktop likely has a static IP configuration that conflicts with the laptop's network settings. Removing the static IP configuration from the desktop will resolve the conflict and allow the laptop to use the required address. Bridging connections, setting DHCP, or replacing network cards don't address the fundamental IP address conflict issue.",

When sensitive data was leaked from a smartphone with an unapproved application installed and the user has command shell access, the next step is to uninstall the unapproved application. The combination of an unauthorized app and command shell access (indicating jailbreaking/rooting) suggests the app may be the source of the data leak. Removing the suspicious application prevents further data exfiltration.

After editing the hosts file to block certain domains, the technician needs to reset the network adapter to ensure the changes take effect. The hosts file maps domain names to IP addresses, and network adapters cache DNS information. Resetting the network adapter clears this cache and forces the system to use the updated hosts file entries. Enabling promiscuous mode is for network monitoring, clearing browser cache affects only web browsing, and adding network adapters is unnecessary for hosts file changes.",
