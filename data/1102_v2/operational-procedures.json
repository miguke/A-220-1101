    "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Communicate to stakeholders. After a change advisory board approves a change request, the next logical step is to communicate the approved change to all relevant stakeholders. This ensures everyone affected by the change is informed about what will happen, when it will occur, and what to expect. Risk analysis should have been performed before the change was submitted for approval. Sandbox testing typically occurs during the implementation phase. End user acceptance comes after successful implementation and testing.",

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) WPA2 with AES. For a 10-year-old SOHO router, WPA2 with AES represents the most secure option available. While WPA3 with AES-256 or AES-128 would be more secure, older routers typically don't support WPA3 as it was introduced in 2018. WPA2 with TKIP is less secure than WPA2 with AES because TKIP has known vulnerabilities and uses older encryption methods.

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Differential. Differential backups are ideal for this scenario because they back up only files that have changed since the last full backup, saving storage space while providing good protection against ransomware. Since only a few files are regularly modified, differential backups will be small and efficient. They also provide faster recovery than incremental backups because you only need the last full backup and the most recent differential backup. Full backups would use too much storage space.

A badge reader provides secure physical access control by requiring authorized personnel to present valid credentials (badges/cards) to enter the data center. This creates an audit trail of who accessed the facility and when. While geofencing, alarm systems, and motion sensors are useful security measures, they don't directly control access - they detect or alert.

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Use a key combination to lock the computer when leaving. Using Windows+L or Ctrl+Alt+Del to lock the workstation is the quickest and most effective way to secure it when stepping away. This immediately requires authentication to regain access. Ensuring no unauthorized personnel are around isn't reliable security. A 30-minute screensaver timeout is too long for sensitive law enforcement data. Turning off the monitor doesn't prevent access - anyone can turn it back on and see the unlocked desktop.",

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) The workstations and the authentication server have a system clock difference. SNTP (Simple Network Time Protocol) synchronizes system clocks. If workstations are forced to use a different SNTP server, their clocks might become out of sync with the domain controller's clock. Domain authentication (Kerberos) is very sensitive to time differences - typically failing if clocks are more than 5 minutes apart. The SNTP server being offline would prevent time sync but wouldn't necessarily cause immediate login failures.

This meets the requirement perfectly. Differential backups capture all changes since the last full backup, so you only need these two sets for complete restoration. Off-site backup is a storage location strategy, not a backup method. Incremental backups require the full backup plus all incremental backups since the full backup.

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Low-level formatting. For repurposing a hard drive that contained PII (Personally Identifiable Information), low-level formatting provides the most thorough data removal while keeping the drive usable. Low-level formatting overwrites every sector on the drive, making data recovery extremely difficult. Shredding and degaussing would destroy the drive entirely, preventing reuse.

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Move factory applications to external memory. When a phone shows 'Insufficient storage space' for updates but has no third-party apps or photos, the issue is likely that factory applications are consuming too much internal storage. Moving factory applications to external memory (SD card) frees up internal storage space needed for system updates. Exchanging for a newer device is unnecessary and expensive.

The technician wants to make sure the printer stays connected in the future and is available on all the computers in the house. Which of the following should the technician configure on the printer?",
    "options": [
      "DNS settings",
      "Static IP",
      "WWAN",
      "Metered connection"
    ],
    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Static IP. Configuring a static IP address ensures the printer maintains the same IP address consistently, making it reliably accessible to all computers on the network. DHCP can assign different IP addresses over time, causing connectivity issues. DNS settings don't affect IP consistency, WWAN is for cellular connections, and metered connection settings are for data usage management, not network stability.",

    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) PII. Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is protected by government policies and regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA. These laws mandate how personal data must be collected, stored, processed, and protected. DRM protects digital content, EULA governs software usage, and PCI protects payment card data, but PII has the broadest government policy protection covering all types of personal information.",

    "question": "A technician has identified malicious traffic originating from a user's computer. Which of the following is the best way to identify the source of the attack?",
    "options": [
      "Investigate the firewall logs.",
      "Isolate the machine from the network.",
      "Inspect the Windows Event Viewer.",
      "Take a physical inventory of the device."
    ],
    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Investigate the firewall logs. Firewall logs provide detailed information about network traffic, including source and destination addresses, ports, protocols, and timestamps, which can help identify the source and nature of malicious traffic. Isolating the machine stops the attack but doesn't identify the source. Windows Event Viewer shows system events but limited network traffic details. Physical inventory doesn't provide information about network-based attacks.",

    "options": [
      "Device encryption",
      "Remote wipe Most Voted",
      "Data backup",
      "Fingerprint reader"
    ],
    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Device encryption. Device encryption ensures that data becomes unrecoverable on a lost or stolen mobile device because the data is encrypted with keys tied to the device's security features. Even if someone accesses the device, the encrypted data cannot be read without proper authentication. Remote wipe can delete data but requires network connectivity. Data backup doesn't protect the device itself. Fingerprint readers provide access control but don't make data unrecoverable if bypassed.",

      "Synthetic",
      "Archive"
    ],
    "correct": [
      0
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: A) Differential. The question asks for a backup method that can back up the OS installation, applications, user profiles, and system settings. However, looking at the options, 'Image' would be the most appropriate choice for backing up all these components as it creates a complete system image. Since 'Image' isn't option A, there may be an error in the question numbering. Differential backups only capture changes since the last full backup and wouldn't include the complete OS installation and applications.",

    "correct": [
      2
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Knowledge base. After resolving a help desk ticket, technicians should update the knowledge base to document the solution and assist other technicians in resolving similar issues in the future. The knowledge base serves as a repository of solutions and troubleshooting procedures. End user training is for educating users, progress notes are for tracking ticket status, and acceptable use policy documents define usage guidelines, not technical solutions.",

    "correct": [
      3
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Acceptable use policy. A Windows splash screen detailing log-in expectations would most likely reference the Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), which defines appropriate behavior and usage guidelines for system access. This policy typically covers login procedures, password requirements, and expected user conduct. EULA covers software licensing terms, NDA covers confidentiality, and regulatory compliance covers legal requirements, but AUP specifically addresses user login and system usage expectations.",

    "correct": [
      3
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Impersonation. This scenario describes an impersonation attack where an attacker creates a fake email address that closely resembles a trusted contact (with one character changed) to deceive the recipient. The goal is to impersonate someone the victim trusts to obtain confidential information. Evil twin refers to rogue wireless access points, insider threat involves actual trusted individuals, and zero-day attacks exploit unknown vulnerabilities.",

      0,
      2
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answers: A) Temperature levels and C) Humidity levels. Temperature and humidity are the most critical environmental factors for data center configuration. Proper temperature control prevents equipment overheating and extends hardware lifespan, while humidity control prevents static electricity buildup (too low) and condensation damage (too high). Server location, noise levels, lighting levels, and cable management are important but secondary to the fundamental environmental controls of temperature and humidity.",

    "correct": [
      2
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Low-level formatting. Low-level formatting is the best solution for securely removing PII from hard drives that will be repurposed. This process overwrites all data sectors with zeros or random patterns, making data recovery extremely difficult. Drilling and incinerating physically destroy the drives (not suitable for repurposing). Degaussing works for magnetic drives but may not be effective on SSDs and also prevents reuse of the drive.",

      3
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: D) Chain of custody. In criminal proceedings, the chain of custody document must be updated every time evidence is touched, moved, or transferred to maintain its legal validity. This document tracks who handled the evidence, when, where, and why, ensuring evidence integrity and admissibility in court. Licensing agreements, regulatory compliance documents, and incident documentation don't serve this specific legal evidence tracking purpose.",

    "correct": [
      1
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Check the machine's certificates. Enterprise Wi-Fi authentication often uses certificates for WPA2-Enterprise or 802.1X authentication. If a user cannot authenticate, the most likely issue is expired, missing, or corrupted certificates on the client machine. Reinstalling the OS is extreme and unnecessary. Resyncing Group Policy might help but certificates are more directly related to Wi-Fi authentication. Power cycling the switch affects all users, not just one.",

      1
    ],
    "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Shredding. Physical shredding is the best way to eliminate data on SSDs for secure disposal. Unlike traditional hard drives, SSDs use flash memory that doesn't respond to degaussing (magnetic field erasure). While drilling can work, shredding ensures complete destruction of all memory chips. Erasing (software-based) may not completely remove data due to wear leveling and over-provisioning in SSDs. Physical destruction through shredding is the most reliable method.",

Scripting languages enable the automation of tasks by allowing administrators to write code that can execute repetitive operations, system configurations, and administrative tasks automatically. Examples include PowerShell, Python, Bash, and batch files. Compiled languages require compilation before execution, web languages are for web development, and database languages are for database queries - none of these are specifically designed for task automation like scripting languages.",
