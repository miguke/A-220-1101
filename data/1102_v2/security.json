This chronological documentation includes the names of individuals who handled the evidence, dates and times of transfers, and the purpose of each transfer. Maintaining proper chain of custody is essential for evidence admissibility in court.

This is the BEST solution because it directly addresses the issue by stopping the browser from sending notifications, which are the source of the problem. Running a full antivirus scan might help if the issue is caused by malware, but it's not the most direct solution. Disabling all Action Center notifications is too broad and might hide important system notifications. Moving specific site notifications from Allowed to Block might not be feasible if the ads are coming from multiple or unknown sources.",

Single sign-on (SSO) solutions allow users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials, and biometric authentication (like fingerprints or facial recognition) eliminates the need to remember complex passwords. Enabling multifactor authentication adds an extra layer of security but doesn't directly address the issue of forgotten passwords.

Deploying client certificates in conjunction with username/password creates multifactor authentication for Wi-Fi access. This combines something you know (password) with something you have (certificate), providing stronger authentication than passwords alone. While certificates do enable encryption and help prevent some attacks, the primary security benefit described is the implementation of MFA.

A cryptominer is MOST likely causing the issue when internet café computers show 100% CPU utilization but no current infection is detected by antivirus. Cryptominers use intensive CPU processing to mine cryptocurrency, which would cause the dramatic slowdown users are experiencing. Modern cryptominers can evade detection by some antivirus software. Spyware typically doesn't cause such high CPU usage, damaged files wouldn't cause sustained 100% CPU usage, and keyloggers operate with minimal system impact.",

Reinstalling the OS ensures a clean start, flashing the BIOS updates the firmware to prevent any BIOS-level malware, and scanning with on-premises antivirus ensures the system is free from malware before returning to service.

PIN codes provide screen lock security that prevents unauthorized users from accessing the device's contents and applications. This is the primary defense against physical access to an unattended mobile device. OS updates provide security patches, antivirus software protects against malware, and BYOD policies govern device usage, but none directly prevent unauthorized access to an unattended device like a PIN code does.",

Since the user can access the public internet but not the internal site on a specific port (8888), the firewall is likely blocking that port or the specific internal traffic.

Metered connections in Windows automatically reduce data usage by limiting background app updates, Windows updates, and other data-intensive activities. This helps control data consumption while still allowing essential connectivity.

Chain of custody is the chronological documentation that records the seizure, custody, control, transfer, analysis, and disposition of evidence. This documentation proves that evidence has been properly handled, hasn't been tampered with, and maintains its integrity throughout the investigation process.

Since the organization already enforces PIN codes as one authentication method, the administrator should enable biometrics as the second authentication method. Biometrics (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.) combined with PIN codes provides true multifactor authentication by combining 'something you know' (PIN) with 'something you are' (biometric). Smart cards and hard tokens require additional hardware, while one-time passwords are typically software-based and may not be available on all mobile devices.",

Checksums are cryptographic hash values that verify file integrity by comparing the calculated hash of the downloaded file with the original hash provided by the website. If the checksums match, the file hasn't been corrupted or tampered with during download. Password managers store credentials, BitLocker and File Vault provide encryption, and secure sites provide HTTPS protection, but none verify file integrity like checksums do.",

An authenticator application is used to generate passcodes necessary to access applications or systems that require an extra layer of security. These apps generate time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or HMAC-based one-time passwords (HOTP) that change regularly, providing dynamic authentication codes for multifactor authentication. Access control lists manage permissions, biometrics capture physical characteristics, and smart card readers process cards, but none generate the dynamic passcodes needed for time-sensitive authentication like authenticator applications do.",

BitLocker provides full disk encryption, protecting all data stored on the hard drive from unauthorized access if the laptop is lost or stolen. Even if someone removes the hard drive, the encrypted data remains unreadable without the proper decryption key. Windows Backup creates copies of data, Shadow Copy provides file versioning, and TPM provides hardware security, but none provide comprehensive data protection like BitLocker's full disk encryption.",

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: C) Phishing. The emails sent from 'john@cOmptia.org' (with a capital O instead of lowercase o) represent a phishing attack. This is a classic example of domain spoofing or typosquatting, where attackers use similar-looking domain names to deceive recipients into thinking the emails are legitimate. The subtle character substitution (O for o) is designed to bypass casual inspection while appearing authentic. Whaling targets executives, insider threats come from within the organization, vishing uses voice calls, and evil twin involves rogue wireless access points.",

Since the attack method was email, educating users about recognizing phishing emails, suspicious attachments, and social engineering tactics directly addresses the root cause. While spam filtering, malware prevention software, and firewall inspection are valuable technical controls, they can be bypassed, making user awareness and education the most critical defense against email-based ransomware attacks.",

When a device is encrypted, all data stored on it becomes unreadable without the proper decryption key, making it virtually impossible for unauthorized users to access sensitive information even if they physically possess the device. Remote wipe can delete data but requires network connectivity, data backup creates copies elsewhere, and fingerprint readers provide access control but don't protect data if the device is compromised at a hardware level.",

    "explanation": "Correct Answer: B) Implementing expiration policies. To prevent security issues from an employee using the same password for multiple applications and websites for years, implementing expiration policies is the best solution. Password expiration forces users to change passwords regularly, reducing the risk of compromised credentials being used indefinitely. This breaks the pattern of password reuse and ensures that even if a password is compromised, its useful lifetime is limited. Firewall settings, complexity requirements, and antivirus updates don't address the core issue of password reuse and staleness.",

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) integrates with existing directory services like Active Directory, enabling single sign-on functionality where users can authenticate to wireless networks using their domain credentials.

When a user clicks a malicious link and the cursor moves on its own while data is being copied to unknown cloud storage, the technician should first quarantine the workstation. This immediate isolation prevents the malware from spreading to other systems and stops ongoing data exfiltration. The system is clearly compromised and actively transmitting data, making containment the top priority.

Content filters can categorize and block websites based on content type, maintain detailed logs of blocked and allowed access attempts, and provide reporting capabilities for management review.

Chain of custody provides a chronological record of who handled the evidence, when transfers occurred, and how the evidence was stored and protected. This documentation is crucial for maintaining evidence integrity and legal admissibility in court.

When only one user cannot connect to network drives while others can, the most likely reason is that the user is not connected to the correct VPN site.
