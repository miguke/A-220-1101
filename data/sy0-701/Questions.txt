NEW QUESTION: 1 – Security Operations
After conducting a vulnerability scan, a systems administrator notices that one of the identified vulnerabilities is not present on the systems that were scanned. Which of the following describes this example?
A. False positive
B. False negative
C. True positive
D. True negative

Answer: A – False positive
Explanation: False positive is when a scanner flags a vulnerability that isn’t actually there. False negative misses an existing vulnerability. True positive correctly finds a real vulnerability. True negative correctly reports no vulnerability exists.

NEW QUESTION: 2 – Security Operations
A security analyst is reviewing alerts in the SIEM related to potential malicious network traffic coming from an employee’s corporate laptop. The security analyst has determined that additional data about the executable running on the machine is necessary to continue the investigation. Which of the following logs should the analyst use as a data source?
A. Application
B. IPS/IDS
C. Network
D. Endpoint

Answer: D – Endpoint
Explanation: Endpoint logs give detailed process and executable events on the host. Application logs only cover specific apps, IPS/IDS logs detect network signatures but not local process details, and network logs show traffic flows without linking back to the exact executable.

NEW QUESTION: 3 – Security Architecture
A newly identified network access vulnerability has been found in the OS of legacy IoT devices. Which of the following would best mitigate this vulnerability quickly?
A. Insurance
B. Patching
C. Segmentation
D. Replacement

Answer: C – Segmentation
Explanation: Segmentation isolates vulnerable devices into their own network zone to prevent attackers from moving laterally. Insurance transfers financial risk but doesn’t stop attacks. Patching may not be available for legacy OS. Replacement takes time and money.

NEW QUESTION: 4 – Security Architecture
An engineer moved to another team and is unable to access the new team’s shared folders while still being able to access the shared folders from the former team. After opening a ticket, the engineer discovers that the account was never moved to the new group. Which of the following access controls is most likely causing the lack of access?
A. Discretionary
B. Time‑of‑day
C. Least privilege
D. Role‑based

Answer: D – Role‑based
Explanation: Role‑based access control grants permissions based on group or role membership. Discretionary is owner‑based rights, time‑of‑day limits when you can access, and least privilege is a principle to minimize rights but doesn’t define group membership.

NEW QUESTION: 5 – General Security Concepts
Which of the following allows for the attribution of messages to individuals?
A. Adaptive identity
B. Non‑repudiation
C. Authentication
D. Access logs

Answer: B – Non‑repudiation
Explanation: Non‑repudiation – Digital signatures prove exactly who sent and signed a message. Adaptive identity is not a standard security control. Authentication verifies identity but doesn’t stop someone from later denying they sent something. Access logs record events but can be altered or disputed.

NEW QUESTION: 6 – Threats
An attacker uses a custom script to continuously request web pages from a server until it becomes unresponsive. Which type of attack is this?
A. SQL injection
B. Cross‑site scripting
C. Denial of service
D. Man‑in‑the‑middle

Answer: C – Denial of service
Explanation: Denial of service floods a system with requests until it can’t respond. SQL injection targets databases, cross‑site scripting injects scripts into webpages, and man‑in‑the‑middle intercepts communications.

NEW QUESTION: 7 – Security Operations
A security operations center is creating use cases for detecting new malware families. Which of the following steps should they perform first?
A. Deploy endpoint detection agents
B. Define normal behavior
C. Develop response playbooks
D. Tune SIEM alerts

Answer: B – Define normal behavior
Explanation: Before you detect anomalies, you must know what “normal” looks like. Only then can you tune alerts, deploy agents effectively, or write playbooks.

NEW QUESTION: 8 – Security Program Management
Which of the following is the BEST reason to conduct a tabletop exercise?
A. Demonstrate compliance with regulations
B. Identify gaps in incident response plans
C. Test network configurations
D. Validate employee background checks

Answer: B – Identify gaps in incident response plans
Explanation: Tabletop exercises walk through scenarios on paper to reveal weaknesses in your plan. Compliance, network tests, and background checks are handled by other audit or technical controls.

NEW QUESTION: 9 – Security Architecture
Which of the following devices would an organization place at the network perimeter to provide stateful packet inspection?
A. Switch
B. Router
C. Firewall
D. Proxy

Answer: C – Firewall
Explanation: Firewalls inspect and track the state of network connections. Switches forward on MAC, routers route packets but don’t inspect state deeply, and proxies operate at the application layer.

NEW QUESTION: 11 – Security Architecture
A network engineer configures a router ACL to allow only HTTP and HTTPS traffic into the web server subnet. Which of the following ACL entries would achieve this?
A. permit tcp any any eq 80
B. permit tcp any any eq 443
C. permit tcp any any eq 80
permit tcp any any eq 443
D. deny ip any any

Answer: C – permit tcp any any eq 80; permit tcp any any eq 443
Explanation: You need two separate permit statements—one for port 80 (HTTP) and one for port 443 (HTTPS). A or B alone only covers one protocol. Deny ip any any would block all traffic.

NEW QUESTION: 12 – Security Program Management
Which of the following would be most useful in determining whether the long‑term cost to transfer a risk is less than the impact of the risk?
A. ARO
B. RTO
C. RPO
D. ALE
E. SLE

Answer: D – ALE
Explanation: ALE – Annual Loss Expectancy calculates expected yearly loss (SLE × ARO), letting you compare the cost of insurance or outsourcing versus the impact if the risk occurs. ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) estimates frequency, RTO/RPO relate to recovery objectives, and SLE is the loss per event.

NEW QUESTION: 13 – Security Architecture
A security engineer needs to configure an NGFW to minimize the impact of the increasing number of various traffic types during attacks. Which of the following types of rules is the engineer most likely to configure?
A. Signature-based
B. Behavioral-based
C. URL-based
D. Agent-based

Answer: B – Behavioral-based
Explanation: Behavioral-based rules detect anomalies by comparing current traffic patterns against a baseline of normal behavior, making them ideal for spotting varied or novel attack traffic. Signature-based only covers known threats, URL-based filters web content, and agent-based implies host agents rather than NGFW logic.

NEW QUESTION: 14 – Security Operations
An assistant is reviewing log files from a newly installed security camera and sees no traffic. Before deploying it live, which of the following should the technician do?
A. Configure the correct VLAN
B. Perform a vulnerability scan
C. Disable unnecessary ports
D. Conduct a site survey

Answer: D – Conduct a site survey
Explanation: A site survey lets you verify camera placement, coverage, and connectivity needs before go‑live. VLAN configuration and port hardening come later in the network rollout; vulnerability scanning applies to software, not initial placement.

NEW QUESTION: 15 – General Security Concepts
Which of the following describes the maximum allowance of accepted risk?
A. Risk indicator
B. Risk level
C. Risk score
D. Risk threshold

Answer: D – Risk threshold
Explanation: Risk threshold (or appetite) is the maximum risk an organization will accept. Risk indicators, levels, and scores measure or quantify risk but don’t define the acceptance boundary.

NEW QUESTION: 16 – Threats
Several employees received a fraudulent text message from someone claiming to be the CEO asking for gift card purchases. Which of the following are the best responses? (Choose two.)
A. Cancel current employee recognition gift cards
B. Add a smishing exercise to annual training
C. Issue a general email warning
D. Have the CEO change phone numbers
E. Conduct a forensic investigation on the CEO’s phone
F. Implement mobile device management

Answer: B, C
Explanation: Adding a smishing exercise educates staff on SMS-based phishing. Issuing a company-wide warning alerts everyone immediately. Canceling existing gift cards doesn’t prevent future attempts, changing numbers is disruptive, forensics on the CEO’s phone is overkill, and MDM manages devices, not human risk.

NEW QUESTION: 17 – Security Operations
Which of the following exercises should an organization use to improve its incident response process?
A. Tabletop
B. Replication
C. Failover
D. Recovery

Answer: A – Tabletop
Explanation: Tabletop exercises walk through hypothetical incidents on paper to identify gaps in response plans and roles. Replication/failover/recovery are technical controls or DR procedures, not planning exercises. 

NEW QUESTION: 18 – Security Program Management
A company decided to reduce the cost of its annual cyber‑insurance policy by removing coverage for ransomware attacks. Which of the following analysis elements did the company most likely use in making this decision?
A. MTTR
B. RTO
C. MTBF
D. ARO

Answer: D – ARO
Explanation: ARO (Annualized Rate of Occurrence) estimates how often an event occurs per year. By lowering the ARO for ransomware, they can justify dropping coverage to save on premiums. MTTR/MTBF relate to repair times; RTO is recovery time. 

NEW QUESTION: 19 – Security Architecture
A business received a small grant to migrate its infrastructure off‑premises. Which of the following should be considered first?
A. Security of cloud providers
B. Cost of implementation
C. Ability of engineers
D. Security of architecture

Answer: D – Security of architecture
Explanation: Designing a secure architecture is the foundational step before evaluating providers, costs, or staff skills. A solid design identifies controls, segmentation, and compliance needs up front. 

NEW QUESTION: 21 – Security Architecture
A software development manager wants to ensure the authenticity of the code created by the company. Which of the following options is most appropriate?
A. Code signing
B. Version control
C. Input validation
D. Secure cookies

Answer: A – Code signing
Explanation: Code signing uses digital signatures to verify code origin and integrity. Version control tracks changes but doesn’t cryptographically authenticate. Input validation and secure cookies address runtime security, not code authenticity.

NEW QUESTION: 22 – Security Architecture
A systems administrator sets up a perimeter firewall but continues to notice suspicious connections between internal endpoints. Which of the following should be set up in order to mitigate the threat posed by the suspicious activity?
A. Host‑based firewall
B. Web application firewall
C. Access control list
D. Application allowlist

Answer: A – Host‑based firewall
Explanation: Host‑based firewalls run on each individual endpoint and filter incoming and outgoing traffic based on detailed rules, so they can block those unwanted internal connections right at the source. A web application firewall protects only web‑facing applications, not general endpoint traffic. An access control list on a network device controls traffic flows at a higher level but can’t enforce rules on every endpoint. An application allowlist stops unauthorized programs from running, but it doesn’t specifically filter network connections between hosts.

NEW QUESTION: 23 – General Security Concepts
A network administrator is working on a project to deploy a load balancer in the company’s cloud environment. Which of the following fundamental security requirements does this project fulfil?
A. Privacy
B. Integrity
C. Confidentiality
D. Availability

Answer: D – Availability
Explanation: Load balancers distribute traffic across multiple servers to keep services up and responsive, directly supporting availability. They don’t prevent unauthorized access (confidentiality), verify data accuracy (integrity), or protect personal data (privacy).

NEW QUESTION: 24 – Security Operations
Which of the following teams combines both offensive and defensive testing techniques to protect an organization’s critical systems?
A. Red
B. Blue
C. Purple
D. Yellow

Answer: C – Purple
Explanation: The purple team is a collaborative effort that merges the red team’s attack simulations with the blue team’s defensive controls into a unified process. The red team focuses solely on offense, the blue team on defense, and the yellow team (often developers) builds tools rather than testing security.

NEW QUESTION: 25 – Security Operations
A security analyst is investigating an alert that was produced by endpoint protection software. The analyst determines this event was a false positive triggered by an employee who attempted to download a file. Which of the following is the most likely reason the download was blocked?
A. A misconfiguration in the endpoint protection software
B. A zero‑day vulnerability in the file
C. A supply chain attack on the endpoint protection vendor
D. Incorrect file permissions

Answer: A – A misconfiguration in the endpoint protection software
Explanation: False positives usually happen because the security software’s rules or signatures are too aggressive or misconfigured. A zero‑day or supply chain attack implies a real threat, not a mistakenly blocked download. Incorrect file permissions would prevent access but wouldn’t typically generate a malware‑style alert.

NEW QUESTION: 26 – Security Architecture
An analyst is evaluating the implementation of Zero Trust principles within the data plane. Which of the following would be most relevant for the analyst to evaluate?
A. Secured zones
B. Subject role
C. Adaptive identity
D. Threat scope reduction

Answer: A – Secured zones
Explanation: In the data plane, Zero Trust focuses on segmenting and securing traffic flows—“secured zones” or micro‑segments—so that every request is authenticated and authorized. Subject role and adaptive identity relate more to control‑plane policies, and threat scope reduction is a high‑level strategy, not a dataplane mechanism.

NEW QUESTION: 27 – Security Program Management
A technician needs to apply a high‑priority patch to a production system. Which of the following steps should be taken first?
A. Air‑gap the system
B. Move the system to a different network segment
C. Create a change control request
D. Apply the patch to the system

Answer: C – Create a change control request
Explanation: Submitting and approving a change control request ensures the patch is authorized, documented, tested, and can be rolled back if necessary. You don’t air‑gap or relocate a live system before planning the change, and you shouldn’t apply the patch without following change management procedures.

NEW QUESTION: 28 – Security Architecture
After a recent vulnerability scan, a security engineer needs to harden the routers within the corporate network. Which of the following is the most appropriate feature to disable?
A. Console access
B. Routing protocols
C. VLANs
D. Web‑based administration

Answer: D – Web‑based administration
Explanation: Disabling web‑based administration removes a common attack surface, especially if that interface uses weak authentication or encryption. Console access can be locked down physically, routing protocols are essential for network operation, and VLANs are used for segmentation—not something you disable for hardening.

NEW QUESTION: 29 – Security Operations
A security operations center determines that the malicious activity detected on a server is normal. Which of the following activities describes the act of ignoring detected activity in the future?
A. Tuning
B. Aggregating
C. Quarantining
D. Archiving

Answer: A – Tuning
Explanation: Tuning involves adjusting detection rules or parameters so that known benign activity no longer triggers alerts. Aggregating combines data for analysis, quarantining isolates potential threats, and archiving stores logs for compliance or future reference.

NEW QUESTION: 31 – Security Architecture
Which of the following security concepts is accomplished with the installation of a RADIUS server?
A. CIA
B. AAA
C. ACL
D. PEM

Answer: B – AAA
Explanation: AAA – RADIUS provides centralized Authentication (verifies user IDs), Authorization (grants permissions), and Accounting (logs session usage). CIA covers confidentiality, integrity, and availability but isn’t a service you install. ACLs are access‑control lists on network devices. PEM is a certificate format, not a security framework 
.

NEW QUESTION: 32 – Security Operations
During a penetration test, a vendor attempts to enter an unauthorized area using an access badge. Which of the following types of tests does this represent?
A. Passive
B. Physical
C. Defensive
D. Offensive

Answer: B – Physical
Explanation: Physical testing verifies controls like badges, locks, and barriers by attempting real‑world access. Passive testing gathers information without interaction. Offensive/defensive describe red vs. blue team activities, not this social/physical check 
.

NEW QUESTION: 33 – Threats
An administrator was notified that a user logged in remotely after hours and copied large amounts of data to a personal device. Which of the following best describes the user’s activity?
A. Penetration testing
B. Phishing campaign
C. External audit
D. Insider threat

Answer: D – Insider threat
Explanation: Insider threat comes from someone within the organization misusing legitimate access—here, after‑hours data exfiltration. Pen tests are authorized, phishing is external deception, and audits are formal reviews 
.

NEW QUESTION: 34 – Security Architecture
A small business uses kiosks on the sales floor to display product information for customers. A security team discovers the kiosks use end‑of‑life operating systems. Which of the following is the security implication of the current architecture?
A. Patch availability
B. Product software compatibility
C. Ease of recovery
D. Cost of replacement

Answer: A – Patch availability
Explanation: End‑of‑life OSes no longer receive patches, leaving known vulnerabilities uncorrected. Compatibility, recovery, and cost are considerations but don’t directly address missing security updates 
.

NEW QUESTION: 36 – Security Operations
A systems administrator is changing the password policy within an enterprise and wants this update implemented on all systems as quickly as possible. Which of the following operating system security measures will the administrator most likely use?
A. Deploying PowerShell scripts
B. Pushing GPO update
C. Enabling PAP
D. Updating EDR profiles

Answer: B – Pushing GPO update
Explanation: A Group Policy Object push instantly applies the new password policy across all domain‑joined Windows systems. PowerShell scripts, PAP (Password Authentication Protocol), or EDR profile changes aren’t as centralized or fast for policy enforcement 
.

NEW QUESTION: 37 – Security Architecture
Which of the following is the best way to secure a non‑site data center against intrusion from an insider?
A. Bollards
B. Access badge
C. Motion sensor
D. Video surveillance

Answer: B – Access badge
Explanation: Access badges enforce and log who enters secure areas, preventing insiders without proper authorization. Bollards stop vehicles, motion sensors detect movement, and cameras record activity but don’t block entry 
.

NEW QUESTION: 38 – Security Architecture
A certificate vendor notified a company that recently invalidated certificates may need to be updated. Which of the following mechanisms should a security administrator use to determine whether the certificates installed on the company’s machines need to be updated?
A. SCEP
B. OCSP
C. CSR
D. CRL

Answer: D – CRL
Explanation: A Certificate Revocation List lists all invalidated certificates so you can compare your installed certs against it. OCSP also checks revocation but requires per‑certificate queries; CRLs are the traditional bulk mechanism 
.

NEW QUESTION: 39 – Security Architecture
Which of the following security concepts is the best reason for permissions on a human resources file share to follow the principle of least privilege?
A. Integrity
B. Availability
C. Confidentiality
D. Non‑repudiation

Answer: C – Confidentiality
Explanation: Least privilege restricts access to only those who need it, protecting sensitive HR data from unauthorized disclosure. Integrity, availability, and non‑repudiation are important but don’t drive minimal‑access rules on a confidential file share

NEW QUESTION: 41 – Security Architecture
While troubleshooting a firewall configuration, a technician determines that a “deny any” policy should be added to the bottom of the ACL. The technician updates the policy, but the new policy causes several company servers to become unreachable. Which of the following actions would prevent this issue?
A. Testing the policy in a non‑production environment before enabling the policy in the production network
B. Including an “allow any” policy above the “deny any” policy
C. Documenting the new policy in a change request and submitting the request to change management
D. Disabling any intrusion prevention signatures on the “deny any” policy prior to enabling the new policy

Answer: A – Testing the policy in a non‑production environment before enabling the policy in the production network
Explanation: Testing changes first in a lab or staging environment catches errors—like blocking legitimate servers—before they impact real users. Simply documenting the change, disabling IPS, or inserting an “allow any” rule doesn’t validate whether the ACL will work correctly under production conditions.

NEW QUESTION: 42 – Security Architecture
During a security incident, the security operations team identified sustained network traffic from a malicious IP address: 10.1.4.9. A security analyst is creating an inbound firewall rule to block the IP address from accessing the organization’s network. Which of the following fulfills this request?
A. access‑list inbound deny ip source 0.0.0.0/0 destination 10.1.4.9/32
B. access‑list inbound deny ip source 10.1.4.9/32 destination 0.0.0.0/0
C. access‑list inbound permit ip source 10.1.4.9/32 destination 0.0.0.0/0
D. access‑list inbound permit ip source 0.0.0.0/0 destination 10.1.4.9/32

Answer: B – access‑list inbound deny ip source 10.1.4.9/32 destination 0.0.0.0/0
Explanation: To block traffic coming from that single IP to anywhere on your network, you deny source 10.1.4.9/32 to destination 0.0.0.0/0. The other statements either block the wrong direction or mistakenly permit it 
.

NEW QUESTION: 43 – Security Architecture
A security administrator would like to protect data on employees’ laptops. Which of the following encryption techniques should the security administrator use?
A. Partition
B. Asymmetric
C. Full disk
D. Database

Answer: C – Full disk
Explanation: Full‑disk encryption scrambles everything on the drive—OS, applications, and user files—so a lost or stolen laptop can’t be read without the decryption key. Partition encryption only covers specific volumes; asymmetric crypto is a key type, not a disk solution; and database encryption protects only database files 
.

NEW QUESTION: 44 – Security Program Management
Which of the following security control types does an acceptable use policy best represent?
A. Detective
B. Compensating
C. Corrective
D. Preventive

Answer: D – Preventive
Explanation: An acceptable‑use policy sets rules that forbid risky behaviors before they happen. It doesn’t detect incidents, compensate for control gaps, or correct problems after the fact.

NEW QUESTION: 45 – Security Architecture
A systems administrator is working on a defense‑in‑depth strategy and needs to restrict activity from employees after hours. Which of the following should the systems administrator implement?
A. Role‑based restrictions
B. Attribute‑based restrictions
C. Mandatory restrictions
D. Time‑of‑day restrictions

Answer: D – Time‑of‑day restrictions
Explanation: Time‑of‑day controls enforce login windows—blocking access outside designated hours. Role‑ or attribute‑based and mandatory controls govern who or how, not when 
.

NEW QUESTION: 46 – Security Program Management
Which of the following can best protect against an employee inadvertently installing malware on a company system?
A. Host‑based firewall
B. System isolation
C. Least privilege
D. Application allowlist

Answer: D – Application allowlist
Explanation: An application allowlist only permits approved software to run, blocking unknown or malicious installers at execution time. Firewalls or isolation don’t stop local installs, and least privilege limits rights but doesn’t prevent execution of malware by an allowed user.

NEW QUESTION: 47 – Security Operations
An attacker posing as the Chief Executive Officer calls an employee and instructs the employee to buy gift cards. Which of the following techniques is the attacker using?
A. Smishing
B. Disinformation
C. Impersonating
D. Whaling

Answer: D – Whaling
Explanation: Whaling targets high‑level executives or uses their identity to deceive. This CEO‑impersonation scam is classic whaling (also called CEO fraud). Smishing is SMS‑based. “Impersonation” is generic, and disinformation is spreading false information, not direct fraud.

NEW QUESTION: 48 – Security Architecture
An organization’s end users are reporting that they are unable to reach external websites. After reviewing the performance data for the DNS servers, the analyst discovers that CPU, disk, and memory usage are minimal, but the network interface is flooded with inbound traffic. Network logs show only a small number of DNS queries sent to this server. Which of the following best describes what the security analyst is seeing?
A. Concurrent session usage
B. Secure DNS cryptographic downgrade
C. On‑path resource consumption
D. Reflected denial of service

Answer: D – Reflected denial of service
Explanation: A reflected DoS (RDoS) uses spoofed source addresses to flood a target via third‑party servers—like DNS—which respond to spoofed queries, overwhelming the victim’s interface. Other options don’t match this amplification behavior.

NEW QUESTION: 49 – Security Program Management
An organization maintains intellectual property that it wants to protect. Which of the following concepts would be most beneficial to add to the company’s security awareness training program?
A. Insider threat detection
B. Simulated threats
C. Phishing awareness
D. Business continuity planning

Answer: A – Insider threat detection
Explanation: Protecting IP often hinges on spotting insiders who misuse legitimate access. Training to detect insider‑style misuse is more directly relevant than phishing, simulations, or continuity planning.

NEW QUESTION: 52 – Security Architecture
Which of the following must be considered when designing a high‑availability network? (Choose two.)
A. Ease of recovery
B. Ability to patch
C. Physical isolation
D. Responsiveness
E. Attack surface
F. Extensible authentication

Answer: A – Ease of recovery; D – Responsiveness
Explanation:
Ease of recovery – You need rapid failover and recovery processes to meet uptime goals.
Responsiveness – The network must react quickly to failures or load spikes to maintain service.
Ability to patch is maintenance, not availability design. Physical isolation can enhance security but may hinder redundancy. Attack surface and authentication extensibility are security concerns, not core HA considerations. 

NEW QUESTION: 53 – Security Program Management
A company is developing a business continuity strategy and needs to determine how many staff members would be required to sustain the business in the case of a disruption. Which of the following best describes this step?
A. Capacity planning
B. Redundancy
C. Geographic dispersion
D. Tabletop exercise

Answer: A – Capacity planning
Explanation: Capacity planning estimates required resources—including personnel—to keep operations running under stress. Redundancy duplicates systems, geographic dispersion spreads risk, and tabletop exercises test plans on paper. 

NEW QUESTION: 54 – Security Architecture
When designing a network for both performance and security, which of the following elements should be placed at the edge to offload SSL/TLS processing from internal servers?
A. VPN concentrator
B. SSL/TLS accelerator
C. Proxy server
D. Load balancer

Answer: B – SSL/TLS accelerator
Explanation: An SSL/TLS accelerator (or offload appliance) handles encryption/decryption at the perimeter, freeing backend servers for application tasks. VPN concentrators manage tunnels, proxies cache/inspect traffic, and load balancers distribute connections but don’t specialize in crypto offload.

NEW QUESTION: 55 – General Security Concepts
Which of the following is the strongest form of multi‑factor authentication?
A. Fingerprint + PIN
B. Smart card + password
C. Password + security questions
D. SMS OTP + password

Answer: A – Fingerprint + PIN
Explanation: Fingerprint (biometric) + PIN (something you know) uses two distinct factor types. Smart card + password is also two factors but hardware tokens can be cloned; biometrics are inherently tied to the user. Password + security questions are both knowledge‑based, and SMS OTP is susceptible to SIM‑swap attacks.

NEW QUESTION: 56 – Threats
A user receives an email that appears to come from a colleague but contains a malicious link. The email’s “From” address was spoofed. Which of the following is the best way to prevent this type of attack in the future?
A. SPF
B. DMZ
C. VPN
D. DLP

Answer: A – SPF
Explanation: Sender Policy Framework (SPF) verifies that incoming mail comes from authorized IP addresses for the sending domain, preventing spoofed “From” addresses. A DMZ is a network segment, a VPN encrypts tunnels, and DLP prevents data loss—not email spoofing.

NEW QUESTION: 57 – Security Operations
Which of the following is the primary purpose of a honeypot?
A. Data backup
B. Threat intelligence
C. Secure communications
D. Performance optimization

Answer: B – Threat intelligence
Explanation: A honeypot lures attackers so you can observe their methods and gather intelligence. It doesn’t provide backups, secure channels, or performance gains.

NEW QUESTION: 58 – Security Architecture
During an audit, it was discovered that backup tapes containing sensitive data are stored off‑site without encryption. Which of the following risks is most relevant?
A. Data in transit
B. Data at rest
C. Data integrity
D. Data remanence

Answer: B – Data at rest
Explanation: Unencrypted tapes off‑site are data at rest and vulnerable if stolen. Data in transit involves moving data, integrity concerns tampering, and remanence is data left over after deletion.

NEW QUESTION: 59 – Security Program Management
A security team wants to measure how quickly incident response procedures are executed end‑to‑end. Which metric should they track?
A. MTTR
B. MTTD
C. MTBF
D. ARO

Answer: A – MTTR
Explanation: Mean Time to Respond (or Resolve) measures the average time from incident detection to restoration. MTTD is detection time only, MTBF is failure intervals, and ARO is event frequency per year.

NEW QUESTION: 61 – Threats
A security analyst notices a significant increase in DNS query traffic to internal resources that aren’t publicly accessible. Which of the following attacks is most likely occurring?
A. DNS tunneling
B. Amplification
C. Reflection
D. Cache poisoning

Answer: A – DNS tunneling
Explanation: DNS tunneling uses DNS queries to exfiltrate data or establish covert channels, often showing high query volumes to internal or unexpected domains. Amplification and reflection involve public servers, and cache poisoning corrupts DNS records rather than generating excessive internal queries.

NEW QUESTION: 62 – Security Architecture
During a security review, an engineer discovers that remote administrators are using unsecured protocols to manage network devices. Which of the following should be implemented to secure administrative access?
A. SNMPv1
B. Telnet
C. SSH
D. HTTP

Answer: C – SSH
Explanation: SSH encrypts management traffic, protecting credentials and commands. SNMPv1 is insecure, Telnet sends plaintext, and HTTP is unencrypted.

NEW QUESTION: 63 – Security Operations
An organization wants to proactively search its network for signs of previously undiscovered malware. Which technique should the security team use?
A. Threat hunting
B. Vulnerability scanning
C. Penetration testing
D. Log aggregation

Answer: A – Threat hunting
Explanation: Threat hunting is the proactive search for hidden threats or malware without waiting for alerts. Vulnerability scans find known weaknesses, penetration testing simulates attacks, and log aggregation just collects data for analysis.

NEW QUESTION: 64 – General Security Concepts
Which of the following describes the principle of “defense in depth”?
A. Implementing the strongest firewall available
B. Using multiple layers of security controls to protect assets
C. Limiting user access to only what’s necessary
D. Encrypting data at rest and in transit

Answer: B – Using multiple layers of security controls to protect assets
Explanation: Defense in depth employs overlapping security measures—firewalls, IDS, encryption, policies—so if one fails, others still protect. A single strong firewall, least privilege, or encryption alone don’t capture the layered approach.

NEW QUESTION: 65 – Security Program Management
Which of the following tasks is part of a risk assessment?
A. Configuring redundant systems
B. Identifying threats and vulnerabilities
C. Writing incident response playbooks
D. Monitoring security logs

Answer: B – Identifying threats and vulnerabilities
Explanation: Risk assessment involves cataloging threats, vulnerabilities, and the potential impact to prioritize risk. Redundancy, playbooks, and monitoring come later in mitigation and operations.

NEW QUESTION: 66 – Security Architecture
A company wants to secure its wireless network using WPA3. Which additional feature from WPA3 provides individualized encryption for each client?
A. PSK
B. SAE
C. EAP
D. WEP

Answer: B – SAE
Explanation: Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) replaces PSK in WPA3, providing a unique key exchange per client for individualized encryption. PSK is the older shared key method, EAP is an authentication framework, and WEP is outdated and insecure.

NEW QUESTION: 67 – Security Operations
Which of the following is an essential first step when performing incident response?
A. Containment
B. Detection and analysis
C. Eradication

A. Impersonation
B. Vishing
C. Misinformation
D. Typosquatting
E. Smishing
F. Phishing

Answer: A – Impersonation; E – Smishing
Explanation: Impersonation – The attacker poses as payroll staff to earn trust. Smishing – This is phishing over SMS. Vishing would be voice‑based, misinformation spreads false data, typosquatting uses look‑alike domains, and phishing usually refers to email 
.

NEW QUESTION: 74 – Security Operations
Which of the following is classified as high availability in a cloud environment?
A. Access broker
B. Cloud HSM
C. WAF
D. Load balancer

Answer: D – Load balancer
Explanation: Load balancer – By distributing traffic across multiple instances, it ensures services remain up even if some servers fail. An access broker handles identity brokering, Cloud HSM secures keys, and a WAF filters web attacks but doesn’t inherently provide redundancy 
.

NEW QUESTION: 75 – Security Architecture
A company's end users are reporting that they are unable to reach external websites. After reviewing the performance data for the DNS servers, the analyst discovers that CPU, disk, and memory usage are minimal, but the network interface is flooded with inbound traffic. Network logs show only a small number of DNS queries sent to this server. Which of the following best describes what the security analyst is seeing?
A. Concurrent session usage
B. Secure DNS cryptographic downgrade
C. On‑path resource consumption
D. Reflected denial of service

Answer: D – Reflected denial of service
Explanation: Reflected DoS – Attackers send DNS queries with the victim’s spoofed IP to open resolvers, which then flood the victim with amplified responses. Few actual queries to your DNS imply reflection/amplification rather than legitimate sessions, downgrade, or on‑path consumption 
.

NEW QUESTION: 81 – Security Architecture
Which of the following methods to secure credit card data is best to use when a requirement is to see only the last four numbers on a credit card?
A. Encryption
B. Hashing
C. Masking
D. Tokenization

Answer: C – Masking
Explanation: Masking replaces most of the card number with symbols, leaving only the last four digits visible for identification. Encryption and tokenization both transform data but still require a key or lookup to reveal the hidden digits. Hashing irreversibly transforms data, so you couldn’t retrieve even the last four digits 
.

NEW QUESTION: 82 – Security Program Management
A company wants to verify that the software the company is deploying came from the vendor the company purchased the software from. Which of the following is the best way for the company to confirm this information?
A. Validate the code signature
B. Execute the code in a sandbox
C. Search the executable for ASCII strings
D. Generate a hash of the files

Answer: A – Validate the code signature
Explanation: Code signing uses a vendor’s private key to sign the software, and verifying that signature with the vendor’s public key confirms both origin and integrity. Hashing only proves consistency, sandboxing tests behavior, and searching for ASCII strings reveals embedded text but not authenticity 
.

NEW QUESTION: 83 – Security Operations
Which of the following scenarios describes a possible business email compromise (BEC) attack?
A. An employee receives a gift‑card request in an email that has an executive’s name in the display field.
B. Employees who open an email attachment receive messages demanding payment in order to access files.
C. A service‑desk employee receives an email from the HR director asking for log‑in credentials to a cloud administrator account.
D. An employee receives an email with a link to a phishing site that is designed to look like the company’s email portal.

Answer: C – A service‑desk employee receives an email from the HR director asking for log‑in credentials to a cloud administrator account.
Explanation: BEC attackers impersonate high‑level or trusted insiders (like HR) to trick employees into revealing sensitive credentials. A gift‑card request is CEO fraud, attachments demanding payment is ransomware, and a generic phishing link is classic phishing rather than targeted BEC 
.

NEW QUESTION: 84 – Security Program Management
A security administrator is re‑issuing a former employee’s laptop. Which of the following is the best combination of data‑handling activities for the administrator to perform? (Choose two.)
A. Classification
B. Sanitization
C. Enumeration
D. Certification
E. Destruction
F. Data retention

Answer: B – Sanitization; E – Destruction
Explanation: Sanitization (e.g., secure wipe) removes sensitive data before reuse, and destruction (e.g., shredding old drives) ensures data can’t be recovered if the drive is retired. Classification, enumeration, certification, and retention don’t reliably remove or destroy data on the device 
.

A company must ensure sensitive data at rest is rendered unreadable. Which of the following will the company most likely use?
A. Hashing
B. Tokenization
C. Encryption
D. Segmentation

Answer: C – Encryption
Explanation: Encryption transforms data so it can’t be read without the decryption key. Hashing is one‑way, tokenization replaces data with a token needing lookup, and segmentation isolates systems but doesn’t obscure data itself 
.

NEW QUESTION: 88 – Security Program Management
A company needs to provide administrative access to internal resources while minimizing the traffic allowed through the security boundary. Which of the following methods is most secure?
A. Implementing a bastion host
B. Deploying a perimeter network
C. Installing a WAF
D. Utilizing single sign‑on

Answer: A – Implementing a bastion host
Explanation: A bastion host is a hardened, single gateway for admin access, reducing open ports and minimizing attack surface. A perimeter network opens an extra segment, a WAF filters web traffic only, and SSO simplifies auth but doesn’t reduce network traffic 
.

Which of the following would be a good use case for orchestration in an account‑creation process?
A. Off‑the‑shelf software
B. Orchestration
C. Baseline
D. Policy enforcement

Answer: B – Orchestration
Explanation: Orchestration automates multi‑step workflows—like creating user accounts across systems—saving time and reducing errors. Off‑the‑shelf software may or may not support workflows natively, baselines ensure consistency, and policy enforcement applies rules but not workflow automation.

NEW QUESTION: 91 – Security Operations
An attacker sends a crafted packet to a server that causes it to crash. Which of the following attack types is this?
A. Replay
B. DoS
C. MITM
D. Spoofing

Answer: B – DoS
Explanation: A Denial of Service (DoS) attack floods or exploits a system to make it unavailable—crashing the server fits DoS. Replay resends valid data, MITM intercepts communications, and spoofing fakes identities.

NEW QUESTION: 92 – Security Architecture
Which of the following technologies provides network‑based malware inspection by analyzing packet contents in real time?
A. WAF
B. NIPS
C. HIPS
D. Proxy

Answer: B – NIPS
Explanation: A Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS) inspects live traffic for malware signatures and anomalies. A WAF focuses on web traffic, HIPS runs on endpoints, and proxies cache or filter but don’t perform in‑depth malware detection.

NEW QUESTION: 93 – Security Operations
A security analyst wants to ensure that future phishing emails are automatically blocked at the gateway. Which of the following features should the analyst enable?
A. SPF
B. Greylisting
C. Email filtering
D. DLP

Answer: C – Email filtering
Explanation: Email filtering at the gateway inspects incoming messages and blocks those matching phishing indicators. SPF helps validate senders but doesn’t block all phishing. Greylisting delays unknown senders, and DLP focuses on preventing data exfiltration rather than inbound phishing.

NEW QUESTION: 94 – Security Program Management
Which document provides a high‑level outline of an organization’s approach to managing information security?
A. Incident response plan
B. Acceptable use policy
C. Security policy
D. Disaster recovery plan

Which of the following best describes an attacker modifying network device firmware to gain persistent access?
A. Logic bomb
B. Worm
C. Rootkit
D. Trojan

Answer: C – Rootkit
Explanation: A rootkit hides itself at a low level (e.g., firmware) to maintain stealthy, persistent control. Logic bombs trigger under conditions, worms self‑replicate, and Trojans masquerade as benign software.

NEW QUESTION: 96 – Security Architecture
An organization wants to segment traffic by department while reusing the same physical switches. Which technology should be implemented?
A. VLAN
B. ACL
C. VPN
D. VXLAN

Answer: A – VLAN

NEW QUESTION: 97 – Security Operations
Which of the following actions would best prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data through instant messaging apps?
A. DLP
B. Antivirus
C. NAC
D. SIEM

Answer: A – DLP
Explanation: Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools inspect content leaving systems—including IM apps—to block or encrypt sensitive data. Antivirus catches malware, NAC controls device access, and SIEM aggregates logs but doesn’t enforce policy on data streams.

NEW QUESTION: 98 – General Security Concepts
Which cryptographic algorithm is symmetric?
A. RSA
B. ECC
C. AES
D. DSA

Answer: C – AES
Explanation: AES is a symmetric block cipher using the same key for encryption and decryption. RSA and ECC are asymmetric public‑key algorithms, and DSA is a digital signature algorithm.

NEW QUESTION: 99 – Security Program Management
A company reviews its risk register monthly and finds many risks marked as “accepted.” Which of the following actions should be taken next?
A. Remove accepted risks from the register
B. Reevaluate the risk threshold
C. Transfer the accepted risks to insurance
D. Monitor the accepted risks for changes

Answer: D – Monitor the accepted risks for changes
Explanation: Accepted risks remain in the register and must be monitored for any change in likelihood or impact. Removing them loses visibility, transferring to insurance applies only if mitigation requires it, and changing thresholds without context risks misalignment.

NEW QUESTION: 101 – Security Architecture
A company is decommissioning its physical servers and replacing them with an architecture that will reduce the number of individual operating systems. Which of the following strategies should the company use to achieve this security requirement?
A. Microservices
B. Containerization
C. Virtualization
D. Infrastructure as code

Answer: B – Containerization
Explanation: Containerization allows multiple applications to run isolated from one another on a single operating‐system kernel, significantly reducing the need for separate OS instances. Microservices describe an application design style but don’t inherently reduce OS count. Virtualization still spins up full OS images per workload, and infrastructure as code merely automates deployment 
.

A technician wants to improve the situational and environmental awareness of existing users as they transition from remote to in‑office work. Which of the following is the best option?
A. Send out periodic security reminders
B. Update the content of new‑hire documentation
C. Modify the content of recurring training
D. Implement a phishing campaign

Answer: C – Modify the content of recurring training
Explanation: Recurring security training that’s updated with context‑specific scenarios keeps users aware of emerging threats and changing work environments. Periodic reminders and new‑hire docs alone miss experienced staff, while a phishing campaign tests but doesn’t directly educate 
.

NEW QUESTION: 108 – Security Operations
Which of the following incident‑response activities ensures evidence is properly handled?
A. E‑discovery
B. Chain of custody
C. Legal hold
D. Preservation

Answer: B – Chain of custody

A. Virus
B. Trojan
C. Spyware
D. Ransomware

Answer: D – Ransomware
Explanation: Ransomware encrypts files (often adding a unique extension like .ryk for the Ryuk variant) and displays a ransom note. Viruses attach to programs, trojans masquerade as benign software, and spyware covertly steals data, but only ransomware locks files and demands payment

NEW QUESTION: 111 – Security Architecture
Which of the following methods to secure credit card data is best to use when a requirement is to see only the last four numbers on a credit card?
A. Encryption
B. Hashing
C. Masking
D. Tokenization

Answer: C – Masking
Explanation: Masking hides parts of the credit card number by replacing digits with symbols, leaving only the last few digits visible. This approach meets the requirement for readability without exposing the full card number. Encryption and tokenization transform the entire value, and hashing is irreversible, so none of them allows partial visibility.

NEW QUESTION: 112 – Security Program Management

A. Digital forensics
B. E-discovery
C. Incident response
D. Threat hunting

Answer: D – Threat hunting
Explanation: Threat hunting is a proactive approach to look for adversaries or TTPs without relying on pre-existing alerts. Forensics and e-discovery happen post-incident, and incident response assumes an alert has already occurred.

NEW QUESTION: 114 – Security Operations
A security administrator is deploying a DLP solution to prevent the exfiltration of sensitive customer data. Which of the following should the administrator do first?
A. Block access to cloud storage websites
B. Create a rule to block outgoing email attachments
C. Apply classifications to the data
D. Remove all user permissions from shares on the file server

Answer: C – Apply classifications to the data
Explanation: Classification is the first step in DLP: understanding what data is sensitive allows policies to be applied appropriately. Without classification, the DLP cannot distinguish sensitive data from regular content.
