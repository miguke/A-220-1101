      2
    ],
    "explanation": "Denial of service floods a system with requests until it can’t respond. SQL injection targets databases, cross‑site scripting injects scripts into webpages, and man‑in‑the‑middle intercepts communications.",

      2

    "explanation": "Adding a smishing exercise educates staff on SMS-based phishing. Issuing a company-wide warning alerts everyone immediately. Canceling existing gift cards doesn’t prevent future attempts, changing numbers is disruptive, forensics on the CEO’s phone is overkill, and MDM manages devices, not human risk.",
