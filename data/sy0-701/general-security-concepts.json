      "Access logs"

      1
    ],
    "explanation": "Non‑repudiation – Digital signatures prove exactly who sent and signed a message. Adaptive identity is not a standard security control. Authentication verifies identity but doesn’t stop someone from later denying they sent something. Access logs record events but can be altered or disputed.",

    ],
    "explanation": "Fingerprint (biometric) + PIN (something you know) uses two distinct factor types. Smart card + password is also two factors but hardware tokens can be cloned; biometrics are inherently tied to the user. Password + security questions are both knowledge‑based, and SMS OTP is susceptible to SIM‑swap attacks.",
