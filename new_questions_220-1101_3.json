Therefore, the correct answer is D: \"Resource pooling.\" This approach allows\nresources to be allocated dynamically to VMs based on their current needs, and ensures that resources are used efficiently in the virtual environment.\nResource pooling is a technique used in virtualization to share resources among multiple virtual machines (VMs). With resource pooling, RAM can be allocated\ndynamically to VMs as needed, allowing all VMs in a virtual environment to have RAM allocated for use.

Sending reminders, enabling duplex printing, and billing departments are useful strategies for reducing\npaper utilization but may not necessarily prevent waste caused by uncollected printouts.\nRequiring a code or badge before releasing a print job is the best solution to prevent the waste of printed materials, as it ensures that only the user who initiated\nthe print job is able to pick up the printed materials.

To enable automatic duplex printing, the\ntechnician needs to read the printer's installation manual to understand how to configure the printer's duplex settings correctly. Once the settings are configured,\nthe printer should be able to print on both sides of the paper automatically.\nTo fix the issue of a newly installed printer capable of automatically printing on both sides of the paper but only printing on both sides manually, the technician\nshould read the installation manual and configure duplex settings. Duplex printing settings can be configured in the printer driver software, which can be accessed\nthrough the printer settings in the Control Panel.

Upgrading the\ninternet plan may not resolve latency issues and may not be necessary if the download test is performing perfectly with very good download speeds.
