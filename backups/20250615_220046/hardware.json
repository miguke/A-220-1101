High latency is a common issue with satellite internet\nconnections, and it can cause slow internet speeds2. Restarting the modem can help to resolve the issue1. The technician should also run an online internet\nconnection and speed diagnostic tool to check the connection and speed1.

Upgrading the\ninternet plan may not resolve latency issues and may not be necessary if the download test is performing perfectly with very good download speeds.
